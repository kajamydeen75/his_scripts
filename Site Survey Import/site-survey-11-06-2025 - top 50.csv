We can combine it if they need it. The property is one of our existing hotels. The sales agent is Stephen Nichols. Park Central NYC and Westhouse NYC hotels are located in the same building. Park Central levels are from B1 to the 18th floor, and the Westhouse Floors are 19-25th. They used to be together, but they were separated later on. They have different networks and different PMS, but they were running from the same ZD3050. We will do vSCG and separate them completely, so for our NOC it will be much easier to identify the issue and there will not be going to share the same network. The only network equipment they will use the same, the ISP feed, and the ISP switch that is in Park Central's MDF. The ISP switch will send the feed to both directions. The Westhouse Fusion is active in support and fairly new. We won't replace it, but will add the 10G NIC to it. We will replace the Core SW with a 1x 7450-48P 8x10G switch. The Westhouse IDF on the 22nd floor is already a 50/125 MM fiber (by the old network diagram), and I hope they ran a 6 strands fiber at least and we will homerun both switches to the Core SW. We will keep the CAT5 (backup connection) Ethernet Cable from Park Central to Westhouse Core SW because it was helping us out many times already. Just in case... So the big difference will be in general, we will separate the Park Central and Westhouse Wireless Controllers to 2 x vSCG. 1 for Park Central and another for Westhouse, and will make 10G backbone with Wi-Fi6 APs. All of the AP locations will be kept in the same location, and we will replace the zf7982 WAPs with R750 WAPs, and all of the smaller zfxxxx series WAPs with R550s. The total AP count in Westhouse is 64. 60 R550, and 4 R750s. I will calculate the AP counts from the ZD because this is one to one swap, and replace the switches with the same switches they have now, so everything should be the same.

I'll try to make it as short as possible.  Suite 2300 is Highgate's owner suite. Inside the big Suite, it splits into 2 suites - 2300A and 2300B.  For bypassing the hotel splash page, they removed the original hotel AP and installed 2 Cisco home type APs in the suites during the renovation years ago.  This Suite has its own cabling system which is very compact in a wall mount IDF box right outside the suite with 3 mini non-POE switches inside.  After years, 2 of the 3 mini switches were dead and nobody replaced them so the AP in suite 2300B was not working and nobody knows since when. That scared the management people.  The current uplink to suite 2300 is from 11FL IDF and nobody was monitoring that 2 ""private"" APs.  I did the speed test last week in suite 2300B after replacing a dead mini switch. I got only 5 mbps in the master bedroom.  I'd suggest: Can you add 2 or 4 Rucks APs (This suite is big. I believe it was renovated from 5 regular guest rooms) in the suites and program them with a special SSID, password and without the splash page?  The cabling can be done. I think there is a HIS Wifi IDF at 22nd FL. Suite 2300 is on 23th FL.  You can talk to Hector, Chief Engineer hsantiago@parkcentralny.com and Steve, Highgate IT skanellopoulos@highgate.com about this project. Both of them are the nicest and responsible persons in the whole New York City.  Based on the above, looks like we need to sell them a project for 4 APs and cable runs for this suite.

The plan was to augment the existing core switch with the Brocade 7450 but now we need to replace the core entirely. Their existing core had a total of 97 cables going into it so we should cover this + have some open ports for expansion.  Something like 2x 48 ports + 1 24 port. 48 ports of PoE should be enough to cover the APs coming out of the core.  The rest of the ports do not need to be PoE.  There are no fiber cable links coming out of the existing core. We do have used Cisco 3750 switches in the warehouse that could cover this order if pricing for new hardware is an issue. We would like to get a quote out today on this because they have roughly 42 out of 327 APs offline currently. Stephen, Michael requested that we work directly with Centrada on this.

We are not adding anything more in level 3, except 1 24 port switch will be replaced with a 48PF. This change is only for the 3-18th floor. Bill J. went onsite and created a signal testing. He could make it work with the heat mapping dongles, but the signal testing revealed the 5G doesn't go through on the floors and he measured -84 in some locations. Alex S. said on the original install we planned the coverage for the panic buttons and the 2.4 coverage was the most important and that's why the 5G is very weak in most areas. We will double the WAP counts on the guest floors and try to keep the 1x3 ratio, like AP - No AP - No AP - AP. because the R550 will cover its own room and the rooms next to it. We will add 162 x R550 WAPs on the 3-18th floor. We will need to run CAT6 cables on the floors and the ceiling tiles are drop ceiling. A total of 162 extra cable drops will be needed.

We can combine it if they need it. The property is one of our existing hotels. The sales agent is Stephen Nichols. Park Central NYC and Westhouse NYC hotels are located in the same building. Park Central levels are from B1 to the 18th floor, and the Westhouse Floors are 19-25th. They used to be together, but they were separated later on. They have different networks and different PMS, but they were running from the same ZD3050. We will do vSCG and separate them completely, so for our NOC it will be much easier to identify the issue and there will not be going to share the same network. The only network equipment they will use the same, the ISP feed, and the ISP switch that is in Park Central's MDF. The ISP switch will send the feed to both directions. We will replace the old cisco core SW with Brocade 3x7450-48P 8x10G Core SWs and will need to move the Fusion from the MDF to the PBX Room Mezzanine Level. Not sure what was the reason why we did not have the Fusion by the core switches before, maybe the PMS system, but with the same uplink cable from the MDF to the PBX room we will connect back the what we need to connect back the two rooms together. We will do a 10G backbone between the PBX Room Core SW and the Fusion and all the Park Central IDFs on B3 IT room, 8 and 11th Floor. The Westhouse IDF on the 22nd floor is already a 50/125 MM fiber (by the old network diagram). We will keep the CAT5 (backup connection) Ethernet Cable Westhouse because it was helping us out many times already. So the big difference will be in general, we will separate the Park Central Wireless Controllers to 2 x vSCG. 1 for Park Central and another for Westhouse, and will make 10G backbone with Wi-Fi6 APs. All of the AP locations will be kept in the same location, and we will replace the zf7982 WAPs with R750 WAPs, and all of the smaller zfxxxx series WAPs with R550s. We will need to run 50/125 OM3 MM fiber between the MDF and the IDFs on B3, 8, and 11th floor, I don't know the exact length, but I will guess a bit longer, so we won't be underbidding the price. We will run 12 strands fiber patch, and all switches will go back to the Core SW. I will calculate the AP counts from the ZD because this is one to one swap, and replace the switches with the same switches they have now, so everything should be the same. Park Central Fusion expired in 2020 and the hardware replacement happen in 2017. We will purchase a new Fusion for them, Westhouse Fusion is active and fairly new. If you can't move the Fusion to the PBX room, let me know, and will add a fiber optic pull from the MDF to the PBX room.

Here is his write-up on this and after some additional notes. This property is one of our existing clients. We will do Wi-Fi6 in the rooms, and Wifi 5 in the outdoor areas because of the availability. Proposal by buildings: Simonton Building MDF side: I propose to reuse the cables that are being used in this building, there are in good condition, and to install an AP in every other room. Tower side: Due to the lack of ventilation and airflow in this IDF propose to move the IDF to the HK office, put a patch panel inside the weather box, and extend the cables that we are going to reuse (around 15) to the HK office, we can use and the existing path between this IDF and the Tranquility HK IDF. I propose to reuse the cables that are being used in this building, there are in good condition, and to install an AP in every other room. In case we keep the IDF in the same place, Isaac, the director of engineering proposes to homerun a new fiber from the MDF to this IDF, There is an existing path, so it&rsquo;s doable.

The sales agent is Stephen Nichols. In the previous proposal, we did not add the switch replacement, this quote includes it. Switches are replaced by the existing AP counts, and port counts. 2 x 24port switches were added as an extra because 2 IPs didn't ping. Scope of Work provided by Hotel Internet Services: Joice went onsite and created a very nice survey of this property. Here is his write-up on this and after some additional notes. This property is one of our existing clients. We will do Wi-Fi6 in the rooms and the common areas --Proposal by buildings-- Simonton Building MDF side: I propose to reuse the cables currently being used in this building, which are in good condition, and to install an AP in every other room. Tower side: Due to the lack of ventilation and airflow in this IDF, we propose moving it to the HK office, putting a patch panel inside the weather box, and extending the cables that we are going to reuse (around 15) to the HK office. We can use the existing path between this IDF and the Tranquility HK IDF. I propose to reuse the cables currently being used in this building, which are in good condition, and to install an AP in every other room. The client should have run an SM fiber from the MDF to the IDF located on the HK tranquility building. Lobby Building: Three cables will be run: one indoor and two outdoor. The indoor AP will be installed in the center of the lobby. The two outdoor APs will be installed, one in front of the pool and the other in front of the parking garage. A fourth indoor AP will be installed directly from the switch in the IDF; no cable will be run for this AP. Duval Building: The client should have run an SM fiber from the MDF to the IDF in this building. I propose keeping the IDF where it is, just putting a rack next to the weather box and installing the switch and a UPS there. I propose reusing the cables in this building, which are in good condition, and installing an AP in every other room. I propose to run 3 outdoor cables for 3 outdoor APs Tranquility Building (formerly Gingerbread building): This building will have 4 IDFs. We will create a new IDF inside the HK office on the building's corner; in the other IDFs, we will replace the existing SWs and run a few outdoor cables for the outdoor WAPs. We will run new cables for the guest rooms in the back of the building. We will use outdoor cables, and the client can cover them afterward. The areas where the cables will run are hidden. Pineapple pool IDF (IDF5): I propose keeping the IDF where it is and adding a UPS. I propose running a cable from the IDF and installing an outdoor AP, facing the Pineapple Pool. Tranquility HK IDF (IDF2): I propose running new cables in the whole Gingerbread building because this building uses indoor cables in outdoor areas. Also, these cables have been in this condition for more than 10 years. I propose running the new cables in the backside of the building using pipes, then penetrating the bathroom and installing the AP on the wall, visible. I propose to build the new IDF inside the housekeeping office. Isaac, the director of engineering, proposes to homerun a new fiber from the MDF to this IDF. There is an existing path, so it&rsquo;s doable. Avalon Alley IDF (IDF4): I propose running a cable for an outdoor AP facing the Avalon guesthouse pool. I propose moving this IDF inside the Avalon Guesthouse kitchen or Avalon Guesthouse laundry room. Passing the cables through a buried pipe in the alley and entering one of those areas Tranquility telephone IDF (IDF6): I propose running 2 new cables for outdoor APs facing the parking lot. No cables will run from this IDF to guestrooms. Tranquility Conference Center Building: I propose running a new cable for an outdoor AP, running a cable to the Conference Room, and installing the AP hidden inside a cabinet. Island Building: Island 1st Floor IDF (IDF8): This building is connected to the MDF using an SMF from the IDF8, and this IDF is connected to the rest of the buildings using SMF. If the fiber coming from the MDF has enough empty fiber strands, we can cross-connect this fiber with the fiber going to the IDFs, so we can have a home run from the MDF to the IDFs. I propose running a cable to the conference room kitchen, which shares the back wall with the IDF, and installing an AP there. Also, we need to run 2 cables to the lobby and office area next to the conference. Island 2nd Floor IDF (IDF9): I propose to reuse the cables in this building, which are in good condition, and to install an AP in every other room. I propose running an outdoor cable for an outdoor AP, and it will be installed in the far corner of the building, facing the Shores Pool. Tortugas Building (formerly D building) Building D GYM IDF (IDF10): This IDF needs a rack and a UPS I propose keeping this IDF; it feeds the rooms on the second floor of this side of the building. I propose running a cable to the fitness center and installing an AP there. Building D Parking Lot IDF (IDF11): I propose keeping this IDF and Installing a rack and a UPS. I propose reusing the cables existing in this building&mdash;they are in good condition&mdash;and installing an AP in every other room. In case any cable is damaged, we can rerun it; there are pipes going to each room. Atlantic Building (formerly A building) Building A-GARAGE IDF (IDF12): I propose keeping this IDF and installing a rack and UPS. I propose running four cables to rooms 6202, 6203, 6302, and 6303. Pipes are going to those rooms, so it will be easy to run them. Building A Attic IDF (IDF13): I propose keeping this IDF, installing a rack and UPS, and installing an AP in every other room.Due to a building remodel, some cables going to the rooms were cut, so we have two options: reuse the ones that are still working and run the bad ones again, or run all the cables again. Pipes are going from the IDF to an access panel inside the rooms. I propose to rerun the 1 cable for an outdoor AP in this building. Building Shores (formerly B building) Building B Attic IDF (IDF14) I propose keeping this IDF and installing a rack and UPS. I propose to reuse the cables that are existing in this building&mdash;they are in good condition&mdash;and install an AP in every other room. In case any cable is damaged, we can rerun it; pipes are going to the rooms. I propose to rerun 2 cables for the outdoor APs in this building. Building Sunset (formerly C building) I propose to keep the IDF where it is. Due to the building's remodeling, almost all the cables to the rooms were cut. There is no existing path to the rooms from the IDF, so I propose running new cables through the back of the building and penetrating and installing the APs in the back of the rooms. I propose to run 4 outdoor cables for outdoor APs. Beach Cafe: I propose to run 4 outdoor cables in this building for 4 outdoor APs. I propose to add a UPS in the IDF. La Mer guesthouse: I propose to keep this IDF. I propose to run 2 outdoor cables for outdoor APs. Dewey guesthouse: I propose to keep this IDF and install a rack and a UPS. Avalon Guesthouse: I propose to keep this IDF and add a UPS. I propose to run new cables for more APs in the rooms and an outdoor cable for an outdoor AP facing the pool. Duval Gardens guesthouse: I propose to keep this IDF and add a UPS. Additional notes: We will replace the Core SW and the Island 1st floor switch that is uplinks the A,B,C,D buildings. We will do the 10G backbone back to the core sw. Here is the cable summary: Outdoor (OD) cable runs we will need: 56 Indoor ID cable runs we will need: 47 The property will need to run fiber between MDF to Duval (P2P to Duval IDF), MDF to Tranquility HK, Island 2nd floor to 1st floor (it can be a long fiber patch cord.) Simonton Tower IDF (outdoor) will be moved to the Tranquility HK IDF. We will need to extend 15-20 cables in the outdoor IDF to install a patch panel and will run cables to the other IDF. We will calculate with 30 drops to make sure we have enough cables to use in case we need them. 15 x ID cable (CAT5e) Lobby Bldg: 2 x OD Cable 2 x ID Cable Duval Bldg: 4 x OD Cable Tranquility Bldg: IDF2: 17 OD Cable IDF5: 1 x OD Cable IDF6: 2 x OD Cable IDF7: 1 x OD Cable IDF4: 10 x OD cable will be moved to Avalon Guest House IDF.

The sales agent is Stephen Nichols. We will modify that a bit because we will need Wi-Fi6 and it was more than 4 years ago. Will refresh it to date with Wi-Fi6 WAPs. THIS IS THE NO CAT6A and NO FIBER version. Core: The MDF is on the level P1. The 1st and 2nd floor WAPs are running back to the MDF. The 2nd-floor meeting hardwired ports are connecting to the 2nd-floor IDF SW (this info is from the Nagios, I didn't see this IDF). If the hardwired ports are going back to the MDF, we will install the new 24-port switch into the MDF. Keep the existing LG-1000 Fusion with the hardware replacement (LG-1500) Upgrade ZD 3125 to a vSCG with 214 new licenses. Upgrade the HP core switch to a Brocade 7450-48P 10G switch and a 7150-24P 2x10G SW IDF x13: Each IDF has an existing HP 2520-48 switch. We are going to upgrade those to Brocade 7150-48P switches. Seems all IDF switches are hardwired switches and floors MDF, 3,6,10,15 have all WAPs connected to them. This setup is set this way because all hardwired switches were non-PoE SW and saving money to replace all switches, we ran long patch cables to a central floor and were able to create an ok coverage (on that time) with 4 additional PoE SWs. We will replace all hardwired switches, with PoE switches and we will not connect every room back to its floor. Will break the long patch cable idea, and patch in the patch panel on each floor. IDFs get their feed from the MDF via Ethernet as an existing. We will keep that as it is. The only new CAT6 cable runs will be the WAPs in the garage area. We added the Garage levels to this proposal but cut back the number of WAPs from 23 to 20 because they want coverage only in the Elevator Lobbies and the Maintenance Rooms. So we will use 4 WAPs per floor. This way we will save money also. We will run CAT6 from the MDF Level P1 to each WAP in the Garage area L1 to L5. 20 WAPs will cover the Elevator and the Maintenance Room. Guestrooms: Current Guestrooms have H500s in them along with 7363 WAPs. The plan is to remove all in-room and 7363 WAPs and replace them with H550s. We will do every other room, and it will have great coverage. We will plug in an R550 to a few IDFs on the guest floor to make sure we cover the Elevator area as well. Khoa said we will need to cover the hallways also, but the H550 will bleed through from the rooms to the hallway. Will add 1 WAP in every 3rd floor electrical closet to cover the Elevator Lobbies. Replace all the R500s and the 1 x zf7372s with R550s/ R650s in the common and meeting areas.

The sales agent is Stephen Nichols. We will modify that a bit because we will need Wi-Fi6 and it was more than 4 years ago. Will refresh it to date with SM fiber backbone. Core: The MDF is on the level P1. The 1st and 2nd floor WAPs are running back to the MDF. The 2nd-floor meeting hardwired ports are connecting to the 2nd-floor IDF SW (this info is from the Nagios, I didn't see this IDF). If the hardwired ports are going back to the MDF, we will install the new 24-port switch into the MDF. Keep the existing LG-1000 Fusion with the hardware replacement (LG-1500) Upgrade ZD 3125 to a vSCG with 214 new licenses. Upgrade the HP core switch to a Brocade 7550-24F 10G switch and an 8200-48PF SW IDF x13: Each IDF has an existing HP 2520-48 switch. We are going to upgrade those to Brocade 8200-48P switches. Seems all IDF switches are hardwired switches and floors MDF, 3,6,10,15 have all WAPs connected to them. This setup is set this way because all hardwired switches were non-PoE SW and saving money to replace all switches, we ran long patch cables to a central floor and were able to create an ok coverage (on that time) with 4 additional PoE SWs. We will replace all hardwired switches, with PoE switches and we will not connect every room back to its floor. Will break the long patch cable idea, and patch in the patch panel on each floor. IDFs get their feed from the MDF via Ethernet as an existing. We will run new SM Fiber from the MDF to IDF3, 6,10. and 15. From these floors, we will run 2 strands of armored fiber patchcord down and up to the floors to make them 10G uplinks. We will have enough space in the core hole. If not, we can remove the patch cables and use the same hole as the cable went before. We will keep the Copper uplink cables to the switches also in case of something failure. We added the Garage levels to this proposal but cut back the number of WAPs from 23 to 20 because they want coverage only in the Elevator Lobbies and the Maintenance Rooms. So we will use 4 WAPs per floor. This way we will save money also. We will run CAT6 from the MDF Level P1 to each WAP in the Garage area L1 to L5. 20 WAPs will cover the Elevator and the Maintenance Room. Guestrooms: Current Guestrooms have H500s in them along with 7363 WAPs. The plan is to remove all in-room and 7363 WAPs and replace them with H550s. We will do every other room, and it will have great coverage. We will plug in an R550 to a few IDFs on the guest floor to make sure we cover the Elevator area as well. Khoa said we will need to cover the hallways also, but the H550 will bleed through from the rooms to the hallway. Will add 1 WAP in every 3rd floor electrical closet to cover the Elevator Lobbies.

I will provide 5 foot white patch cables for you to ensure you have enough length on the cable. H500s will all need a bracket. Ensure you punch the keystone behind the wallplate and run the cable behind the wallplate so the guests dont unplug the cables. You will need to come out of the WAPs and feed the guestroom hardwired ports. You will need to configure the 7363 and H500 WAPs to the correct VLAN to ensure clients get the correct portal page.

Taj Club House (15th floor) Roof Meeting Room (17th floor),Provide outlets for new IDF switches where needed.,"Bill Johnson went onsite and here are his notes: (See Ferdinand's Notes below). HIS SOW: There are two towers of guest rooms. The Newbury Tower has 16 floors and was the original hotel with a roof tented meeting space as the 17th floor. The second Tower, the Commonwealth, is joined to the Newbury tower up to the 7th floor. The upper floors of the Commonwealth Tower are not part of the hotel and are private condos. Floors 1 to 3 of both Towers are not used for guest rooms. These floors have meeting, dinning spaces or staff offices. The basement has engineering offices and will need wifi coverage. You will see that there is a drawing included of the existing APs on floors 1 to 3. I show most of them but there might be one or two missing which you can find on the included WAP list from the Chief Engineer, Moreen, but the key ones are there. These are important in that per my signal testing we can reuse the existing cabling to these APs with very few additional cable runs. As to the guest rooms in both Towers, there is network cable to each room. I propose using H510s in the guest rooms which, in most rooms, can be mounted on the network jack in the room (see my photos - a few rooms may need standoffs depending on the orientation of the jack plates). As to the IDFs, they are using multi-mode fiber to connect to the IDFs from the MDF. They are using older HP switches which should get replaced. Here are notes as to where new cable runs and IDFs will be needed: BASEMENT - We should create an IDF in the basement with a Brocade 7150 12-port PoE switch for the proposed APs there. One of the old time engineers there knows how to get cable from the MDF to the basement. It&rsquo;s a little tricky in that it&rsquo;s easy to get cable from the MDF on the 3rd floor to the kitchen on the 2nd floor (drop ceiling), but then you have to go across the kitchen to get to the basement. However, there may be existing spare cable already into the basement that can be used for an uplink. LOBBY - One cable may need to get run to the FD Office for an AP there. LOBBY BAR - The existing AP here is above an access panel near the bar on one side of the space. Per signal test, 5G isn&rsquo;t getting all the way into one corner. If that AP can be relocated further toward the center of the room it should handle that otherwise a second AP will be needed. In this case it may be necessary to put a Brocade 7150-12 port POE switch in the Bar (I included that in the proposal). 2nd FLOOR KITCHEN & SECURITY OFFICE - We should create an IDF with a Brocade 7150-12 port POE switch in the Kitchen area. There is one existing AP in a closet near the Private Dining Room that could be used as an uplink to the MDF, or we can easily pull a new cable from the MDF on the 3rd floor if needed. We will need to pull 6 to 7 cables for the kitchen area including one for the back of the Board Room (there is an existing AP for the Board Room near Taj I & II) but it needs to get moved. There is a Security Office in the loading dock area down stairs from the Kitchen. This office will need Wi-Fi. We may be able to find a spare cable in that office or run one. 3rd FLOOR - For the meeting rooms on the Newbury side we can use the existing wall jacks to mount APs for those spaces. But, the Staff areas that are mainly on the Commonwealth side may be too far from the MDF to get a cable to. So an IDF should get created here with a Brocade 7150 -12 port POE switch with uplink back to the MDF or an existing IDF. The staff areas have drop ceilings and possible existing spare cables may exist in the offices there that can be used for an uplink to an existing IDF. 4th to 16th FLOORS - The guest room floors have existing cabling and wall jacks including in the Fitness Center. These can be used to mount APs. The only questionable area is the Housekeeping Office in the 5th floor. There should be existing cabling there but may need to pull a cable from the IDF on the 6th floor. 17th FLOOR - On the roof meeting room we will need to pull an additional cable from the existing switch location in the foyer. That existing 8 port switch in the Foyer will need to be replaced with a Brocade 7150-12 port POE switch. Ferdinand's Notes: Here are where all the IDFs are and what floors they service. MDF: Feeds WAPs on floors Lobby - Floor 3 and 62.5/125mm fiber with SC terms to 5th - Feeds in room hardiwred ports in the Commonwalth tower on floors 4-7 (7150-48G-POE) 6th - Feeds in room hardwired port in the Newbury tower on floors 4 - 7 (7150-48G-POE) 8th - Feeds in room hardwired port in the Newbury tower on floors 8 - 10 (7150-48G-POE) 11th - Feeds in room hardwired port in the Newbury tower on floors 11 - 14 (7150-48G-POE) 15th - Feeds in room hardwired port in the Newbury tower on floors 15 and 16 (7150-48G-POE) 17th Floor - Feed R510 WAPs x 4 (7150-12G-POE) We need to add IDFs: Basement - 12 port POE Switch Lobby Bar - 12 port POE Switch. 3rd floor Staff area - 12 port POE Switch.

The guest rooms have plaster lath walls and do not pass 5G as well as the newer Tower, the Commonwealth Tower.

We will power those cameras via a Coax and power cable running from the elevator machine rooms (total of 3) to inside the cabs.

I spoke to Groove and they said to put in 7500 for the 11 encoders needed to go from Coax to IP. These 11 channels along with the DirecTV 48 channels will give the hotel 59 total channels for both Common areas and Guestrooms. Work with Anthony Fleming at Groove on the encoder needed. 2/20/2019 Client wants us to hang all Guestroom TVs. They will already have the mounts installed for us so its pretty much just unboxing the TVs, plugging them in and then installing them on the wall mounts as we do our BTV install/Wi-Fi install.
