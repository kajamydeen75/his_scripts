Only One Main Bldg. We landed on this property because The Hotel staff was not satisfied with the service offered by the previous provider.  They suspended the payment and ended the relationship. But the credentials were never provided.  All the configuration and network information was collected onsite and remotely. The network is a combination of Nomadix, Netgate, and Unifi Network, and then we Installed a Fusion with GuestCast Server. Casting is working from our casting server (Chromecasts were factory reset and placed on a new Google Account; see Equipment list for details) We replaced the old remotes with the Slate Remote (no guide button). Since STBs and TVs are LG we just needed to reconfigure the Casting button to switch to HDMI1. SWs uplink is Cat6. APs are Nomadix; they are PoE.  They had two Gateways onsite before us to manage the guest network (Nomadix and Netgate) with no credentials, then only some networks were moved to the Fusion: See the breakdown below ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------.

Netgate: VLAN 850 to manage the STBs --- This network stays in Netgate to guarantee the STBs don't loose the Channel Lineup.

A wireless network with the hidden SSID “btvcasting” is currently in place, and a dry VLAN tagged with the ID 500 is also present.   ","On Samsung and LG TVs, the Guest device is connected to HDMI 2. However, some suites, for example, have an LG TV in the Bathroom, and the Guest cast device is connected to HDMI 3.   All Guest cast devices are powered by the TV's USB port. The Guest cast is secured to the Coax Cable, which allows the Property to replace the TV without cutting the Security cable of the Guest cast.

Wi-Fi is supported by Unifi AP Pros, and they are configured in a Hallway deployment for the 1st and 3rd floors.  Wan 1 and IPMI are connected to ports 1 and 2 of an unmanaged 5-port TP-link switch, Lan1 and Lan2 are connected to the Unifi core switch on ports 6 and 7.  Lan 1 is the Guest Wifi, and Lan 2 is for the Guest cast devices on Vlan 500.    ","Please note that VLAN 500 on our server is tagged and not untagged.  The IT vendor is not able to configure VLAN 500 as untagged traffic.  No Configuration to LG TVs was needed, but for the Samsung, we had to disable the HDMI-CEC, which is located in the settings of the TV.  We also had to turn off the Home welcome Logo, so that once the TV is turned on, it will go to a live channel.  To turn off the Home logo, we had to go into the Hospitality mode of the TV by selecting the Mute button, 119, and the Enter button.  Once in the Hospitality menu, you will need to scroll down to a tab called OSD, and in there, you can turn on or off the Home welcome logo.  Please see the Samsung TV video located in the SharePoint folder for the property.    On Samsung and LG TVs, the Guest device is connected to HDMI 2. However, some suites, for example, have an LG TV in the Bathroom, and the Guest cast device is connected to HDMI 3.    The Guest Cast remote has a Guide button, but it is not configured.  The property has sub-channels, for example, 10-1 is the same as channel 10.  We are not able to program the Guide button for a channel.

We added 4 new switches at Parkway: 10.20.8.43 - Building1 1st Floor 10.20.8.44 - Building1 1st Floor 10.20.8.45 - Building1 1st Floor 10.20.8.46 - New Core Building 21 All wireless bridges are now Offline. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- P2P in Bldg 12 IDF - the key for this room is labeled ""S4"" in case we need to open the door. They never find the right key for this door... Because the regular master key for the other rooms is labeled as - V-. Just FYI  The property is running dynamic VLANs (201-250) and the clients are load balanced through the 3 fusion cluster nodes. The routing is happening at the switch level with the 2 switches in the MDF (3500y & 2920) and the one on building 5 IDF (2920). The 2 switches in the MDF are handling 17 VLANs each and the one in building 5 is handling 16 VLANs. The default gateway for all those VLANs are the switches and the Fusion doesn't need to know anything about those VLANs. Within each switch VLAN the IP-helper command was issued to point to the respective node to handle DHCP. In the ZD only these 3 switch mac-addresses were white listed for client isolation. Also note that custom DHCP option groups were associated with each DHCP pool to provide: default gateway, subnet mask, and DNS. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Primary wireless link between core and buildings 12-19 is an AirFiber bridge between building 5 and building 12. There is a redundant link between Building 2 and Building 17, that is disabled by default to prevent loops. The master is connected to port 24 on the Building 5 POE switch (10.20.8.14). If this link fails, port 24 on Building 2 POE switch (10.20.8.11) must be enabled to bring up the redundant link.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The MDF in building 5 is locked and can only be accessed using a code on the door.  The code to enter this room is 3585.  Many of the staff do not know this code so you made need to tell them what it is if the room cannot be accessed. - Walter 6/6/19 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Building 1 IDF can only be accessed with a keypad now on the door. The code to enter the room is 8787* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Bldg12 Airfiber WPS http://4.35.248.123:65405/ In case Link1 is down, enable P2P Bldg2.

The default IP configuration is Carrier Grade Network Address Translation (CGNAT) using private address space assigned to Starlink clients with DHCP from the 100.64.0.0/10 network.   Network Address Translation (NAT) translates between Starlink private and public IPs.   The Starlink public IP policy is an optional configuration available to Business and Maritime customers. A public IP is reachable from any device on the internet and is assigned to Starlink network clients using DHCP. Moving the Starlink to another location may cause the public IP to change. Starlink does not currently offer the ability for Residential or Roam customers to receive a public IP. The public IP option can be enabled from the account dashboard.  Each Starlink is allocated one IPv4 address and delegated a /56 IPv6 prefix for network clients.  All Starlink network clients are assigned an IPv6 address if the router is IPv6 is capable. IPv6 is not supported on the early generation router in the Circular Starlink Kit.  The default IP policy using CGNAT blocks all inbound ports.  Customers requiring inbound ports should consider products with a public IP option.  The following outbound ports are blocked for all customers per information security best practices: TCP/25 (SMTP) and TCP/445 (SMB).  As Starlink continues to expand and upgrade our global internet service infrastructure and rollout new capabilities, some users may see different IP address behavior (for example, publicly routable addresses, IPv6, non-CGNAT).  v.

The following rooms will have a TW522: 300,304,306,308,312,317,402,410,415,500,504,505,507,512,517,602,609,615.700,704,706,707,711,717,802,809,814,904,905,907,910,912  Per the clients request, the Zyxel VDSL switch was kept along with modems in specific rooms to provide wired room connections to specific rooms. Zyxel Core switch has VLAN setup to allow public static address to be used.  Core Switch VLAN data:  See Equipment List for Core SW info and For DSLAM information ","This property was upgraded. Location of AP were changed. Now all equipment for guest room coverage is located on floor 3, 5 & 8. There are 5 APs/floor. A ZD & SMC VDSL switch were added to telco room. Which have made the phone jacks   Rooms:  APs & modem are generally located behind TV stand. Where noted on WAP list, AP is located underneath night stand. The following new AP (TW522) for Phase one are currently located in the following rooms: 602,609,615,700.706,707,711,802,809,814,  MDF: Garage level in housekeeping office. Rack holds Procure, Sonicwall, ZD, Zyxel core switch (vlan'd) & VDSL switch (wired room connections), timeout device & SMC VDSL switch. Now racked is the Fusion A200, and two Zebra Dslams.  ISP modem in an equipment room by the parking garage service elevator   Common areas: City Scene/Meeting Room 01 and Meeting Room 02: AP located in ceiling in chair room. 2nd Fl Foyer AP is located near the Elevators 9th Floor: under renovation Bar AP: located in waiter station. lobby: located behind internet station  MSM710 Gateway is located on the basement level in the telco room","The MDF is where all the phone lines are located, the 66 Blocks were either not labeled or the labels faded.  I have marked all the blocks that were not labeled or faded.  The phone lines in the rooms are corroded or have a lot of residue in the phone jacks.  Recommend a can of compressed air to clean out the phone jacks.

This is due to a few factors, but I noted that guests have unplugged BTV, and when plugged back in, the Chromecast was plugged into HDMI 2 as well as BTV into HDMI 1 for example. This is something to note as guests bring gaming consoles from time to time and mess up the installation.  Neatening up all the cabling and cable tying everything yielded good results, however, each room has a different powerpoint setup whereby some have 2x power outlets behind the TV, others have only 1.   Due to the BTV power supplies having lights on them, I have put 80% of them behind the TV, with 20% of them powered down by the desk. This was unavoidable, and we would recommend a power board be used behind the TV to plug both the TV and BTV in neatly behind the TV. A powerboard is preferred over getting an electrician to install a double powerpoint as the locations of the power points hit the back of the bracket leaving the TV protruding from the wall.   IR Blasters ------------------------- Working with Raf and Juan, we noted issues with the IR Blasters not working correctly due to poor wifi signal strength. I have placed each IR blaster on the top side of the TV, closest to the side where the nearest AP is. For example, some rooms may have the IR blaster on the top left, others on the top right. This yielded the least interference as placing the blaster down the base of the tv was causing too much interference and not working at all.   WiFi Signal Strength ------------------------- Conducting tests around the property, I noted the network was a 2.4ghz only network, using a cheaper style outdoor AP pointing back towards the rooms.   Firstly, testing indicated average RSSI values of -72dbm in most rooms, with download links of 6-8mbps at the best of times. The best signal strength I saw was -67dbm, and the worst -79dbm.   In the evening, in my room, with an RSSI of -69dbm, download speeds would range from between 2.4mbps, to 8.8mbps. Note this is with only 3 other rooms occupied at the time. The hotel was not busy.  Secondly, capacity will likely be a problem with these access points. With every room having a Chromecast, BTV STB, and IR blaster connecting to the network, I don't believe the current setup will hold up once you introduce client devices.   Whilst I don't know exactly how many AP's they have at the site, I know that there wasn't more than a couple visible.   My experience  ------------------------- In my experience of casting overnight, it worked great, however, the video quality did change frequently due to the wireless signal strength and wireless speeds. When there was no one else at the property, my remote was working, however would be slow at times. At best, it was 1 second, at worst, 40 seconds. I assume this kind of delay would make a customer press the button twice, thus creating a problem for the macros.   Moving forward ------------------------- Jacob will likely be expecting an update, however, due to all the issues we have previously had, I'd like to include you guys in what happens next rather than me sending an email with my findings. You're more than welcome to quote everything I have said, but I think it's best we book in a call tomorrow between LP Australia, and you guys to discuss how to update the client.   *************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************  PMS ------------------------- Our PMS interface is a local instance of PMS Proxy running on the Caching Server (lincolndowns.hotelwifi.com:50007) at the property. Hibox connects to this local PMS Proxy through a port forward on the Admin router (56700 to 56700) and then another port forward on the Fusion (56700 to 6700). Hibox is configured to hit lincolndowns.hotelwifi.com, so as long as that DNS record is updated in the event of a public IP change, the interface should survive.  On prem, the Caching Server is hitting the Protel PMS Connector at 192.168.20.150 on port 5006. The path from the Caching Server to the PMS is simply via the Caching Server's default gateway (the Fusion) to the Fusion's default gateway (admin router) to the PMS interface.

In the case of failure of one of the units, the other will take over in a matter of minutes. The SSIDs will be broadcasting, but there would be no connectivity to the Gateway during the switch (tested at one of the properties). No intervention is necessary, just wait.  Fusions on the other hand are not redundant. The main Fusion is the Brain of the operation. It backs up to 2 locations: daily to the backup Fusion (there is a special VLAN for it) and Weekly to ftp.hotelwifi.com.  In the event of the failure of the main Fusion, the secondary Fusion can be accessed through WAN. It will NOT take over automatically. It is a MANUAL PROCESS. The Backup Fusion would have to be loaded with the latest backup from the main Fusion.   Both Fusion's interfaces are the mirror copies of each other in terms of networking on the switches. Once the Backup Fusion is up and running, it will work exactly as the main one.  **where help is needed please email lho.pt@loewshotels.com which is our team email.

""""""What happens here is that every time the iPhone moves to a new SSID, it changes its MAC and the Fusion thinks it's a different device and requires the person to go through the portal page again. However, it doesn't end there. If the guest already connected to that antenna, it's saved the password and so the iPhone will just sit there and appear to be connected but won't bring up the portal page, even though the Fusion’s waiting for the portal page to be checked.      There is a temp solution until the Owner upgrades and that is to have the guest forget the network every time he connects to a different SSID, which means a different antenna. It doesn't look like Androids have this issue so it's maybe 50% of the guest will have to forget their network and click through the portal page constantly when moving around the property.       Again, putting in a new network with only one SSID is the solution and I'll get the proposal to Jack ASAP""""""""  ",Fusion WAN1 https://yosemitebug.hotelwifi.com/admin 64.118.102.178  IPMI https://yosemitebugipmi.hotelwifi.com 64.118.102.179  Unifi Controller HIS ---- (2x SW-48P and APs) https://unifi.hotelwifi.com:8443  P2P Bridge NanoBeam https://yosemitebug.hotelwifi.com:60025 https://yosemitebug.hotelwifi.com:60026  Mikrotik WAN ***For remote access Download WinBox.exe from: https://mikrotik.com/download use below Public IP address and credentials to login Eth1 ---WAN IP: 64.118.102.180 Mask: 255.255.255.248 DG: 64.118.102.177 MAC: 08:55:31:D5:C3:A3 admin / GsquidPineapplejelly7&  WattBox  64.118.102.181  Google Docs Link https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Z-lWVHAHNDDHddzXjbcEvX1rhJLKXKYm,"SierraTel Internet  Support contact number: 209.966.3636 x 3 Property’s account number: 00018046-1 209.966.6666, PIN 0360 or 4283, Security Question answer: Datsun Street address associated with the ISP account: 6979A California State Highway 140, Midpines, CA 95345 Fiber Optic Upload speed: 100 ea Download speed: 200 ea CIDR: 64.118.102.176/29 Default Gateway: 64.118.102.177 Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.248 DNS: 64.118.98.89          64.118.98.90 Usable IP addresses: 64.118.102.178 through 64.118.102.182",,,,,,,,,0,12-03-2021,09-04-2025,BE86AE57-6A2A-4142-89C9-135A36C80086

Please note that the brocade ICX 7150 48P switch for Lan 1 and 2 are using firmware 8030 and the ports are configured in dual mode.   The is the issue that was found at the property pertaining the Dish headend: I found the issue with the TV at the Edgewater and the Inn, the dish headend here at both hotels have a controller that holds all the tv information. This controller puts all the TV’s in MPI-FTG mode and this is what is causing all our issues. For us to use a direct button input the TV needs to be in CPU-FTG mode which means the TV will need to have a file (FMA/TLX) that the channel lineup would be installed and then the TV will be able to control these features like HDMI inputs. The way it is now the Dish headend controls those features, so if we cannot by pass this controller the Guest cast remotes will not work correctly. I have tested this theory and I am correct. so what I did was remove the coax from the TV and then did a factory reset on the TV. Once done I looked at the Mode of the FTG and it was changed to CPU-FTG, at that point I was able to use a new guest cast remote and change the input for casting and for live tv. everything worked like it was supposed to. Here is the kicker, when I reconnected the coax cable to the TV and turned it back on the TV the controller at the dish headend reinstalled the file of the TV back to what it was before. Now the Guest cast remote no longer works like it was supposed to do. So the only way we can change the input is to program the casting and live tv button to open the input menu and the  guest will need to select the input they want to use, so the issue is not with the remotes it has to do with Dish network controller.

There are 2 newer TVs in rooms 604 and 605 respectively that are mounted on the wall so, they must be removed for troubleshooting. However they too have been factory reset and power savings set to 001. To check this setting you must first unplug the MPI cable either from the TV or the STB [USB}. Then using the LG remote, press the menu button rapidly until the menu does not paint on the screen, then enter 9-8-7-6 then enter [or select]. You will see the installer menus in white letting. Arrow down to 118 Power Savings   it should be 001  if not enter 0-0-1 then arrow up or down and press select. Plug in the MPI cable and Power cycle the TV and set-top-box. You should be able to turn the TV on and off with the BTV remote RC-11  The TV s in the new South Tower (09 to 18 rooms) are Samsung TVs and have MPI cables with RC-11 remotes. Flash files were left with Engineering on BTV 2GB thumb drive. The TVs are all wall mounted and require 2 people to remove them. Troubleshooting should be able to be performed however without removing the TVs, with exception of the xx18 rooms.  ******************************Chromecasts at this property are connected to STBs. How to verify:******************************************* adb into the set-top box adb shell cat /system/build.prop Look for beyondtv.mpi.chromecasthdmi=hdmi2 command, if this command doesn't exist that means the chromecast is connected to STB. ************************************************   **** For New STBs - LG ONLY **** This property is using STBs as a brain for the TVs. We are controlling the LG TVs via the MPI cables.  If you get an STB online that hasn't been properly provisioned, you need to do the following until we release a new firmware that has all the options built it: 1. Assign the STB a static lease  If you are swapping a STB in a room, make sure to replace that box 2. Ensure the box is running an Elliot Park firmware (use BTV Admin) This is an automatic process and as long as the box is connected to the correct network, it will eventually upgrade. Usually 5-10 minute process. If it is not upgrading (you can use adb_logcal to see that), then reboot it. 3. from the Nagios server, ""adb_connect xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx"" to the box, where xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx the IP of the box 4. Run the following command ""adb_mpi_install"" ***************************  IF FUSION FAILS, MOVE TRAFFIC OVER TO EDGEROUTER: ------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1. Connect to the EdgeRouter using your web browser. 2. Open the EdgeRouter CLI by clicking on the CLI button found on the top right of the web user interface. 3. Ssh into the Core Switch(172.16.0.10) from the EdgeRouter terminal. 4. Disable port 1/1/24, which is connected to the Fusion LAN1 (This eliminates the LAN traffic to hit the Fusion) 5. On the EdgeRouter dashboard, enable all the VLANs using the ""Actions"" button to the right of each VLAN. 6. Using the ""Actions: button, edit the ""MGMT-VLAN100"" and change the EdgeRouter IP address from 172.16.0.7/24 to 172.16.0.1/24. 7. Under the ""Services"" tab, enable the DHCP server named ""MGMT-VLAN-100"" using the ""Actions"" button.

The MDF is located in the electrical closet on the first floor. The hotel offers three Wi-Fi networks: Sea Crest Wi-Fi, Seacrest OTT, and Sparklight_HSO.   The Guest SSID utilizes our Splash Page for authentication, requiring an access code of 12344321.  They have a Single SM FC/LC for the MDF and the IDF, they have a Single SM SC(APC) to LC (UPC)","Core SW (CoreSW-MDF1-1) is located in the MDF.  The other two 48-port switches (SW-MDF-1-1 and SW-MDF-1-2) are also located in the MDF.  The Microtik Backup GW is also connected to the MDF. The following equipment is also located in the MDF, specifically in the Wattbox, the Fusion, and the Eaton 3000VA UPS. We also have the Fiber patch panel, which is a Single SM FC/LC. In the Admin office, we have the 12-port Brocade SW (SW-IDF-1-1). The following APs are connected to ports 1-2: the AP Lounge and the AP IDF. We also have a Tripplite 1500VA UPS.  The fiber patch panel from the IDF is a Single SM fiber with SC/LC connectors.  ","MDF is located on the 1st floor, in the Electrical closet.  The UPS is on the side of the Rack due to the rack not being deep enough to support the Eaton 3000VA UPS and the Fusion.  The Patch panel is at the bottom of the rack because the Ethernet cables were not long enough, the LV team was testing, or replacing the Ethernet cables as needed.  The existing Ethernet cables are Cat 6 unshielded, and they are not in conduit.  The Cables are on the ground, and most are sitting in water. The cables that were replaced were damaged due to rodent activity, specifically chewing on them.  Please note that most issues with AP down are due to cabling problems.  The pathway of the Ethernet cables from the MDF to the Guest rooms is from the ground level of the 1st floor through the AC closet of the 1st guest room to the 5th floor.  For example, room 107 has a stackable AC closet, followed by 207, then 307, and so on, until you reach 507.  This is the only way to get Ethernet cables from the 1st floor to the 5th floor.  There are 3- 48-port switches in the MDF. The first switch controls the guest rooms 101 to 303.  The Second Switch controls the Guest rooms 305 to 424.  The third switch controls the guest rooms 501 to 524 and Pool 1 and 2.  We have an SC/LC fiber patch panel from the Admin Office - IDF that connects to a Fiber patch panel FC with an LC connector.  Please note that the fiber (SM) was distributed as a single connection fiber. To use any of the strands, you will need a Bidirectional SFP.  The ISP fiber switch is located in the MDF. The circuit is a 2G/2G SM fiber. Our uplink port on the fiber switch is port six, which is connected to Port 1/3/1 of the Core switch.  The 10 Gbps connections from the Fusion are connected to the core switch in ports 1/3/2 (Wan2) and port 1/3/3 (Lan2).  On the CoreSW port 1/3/4 is the 10G direct cable to SW-MDF-1-1, Port 1/3/1. On Sw-MDF-1-1 (port 1/3/2) to SW-MDF-1-2 (port1/3/1).  There are six patch panels. The 1st patch panel is for the Pool APs, the 2nd patch panel is for the guest rooms on the 1st floor (101-124), and the 3rd patch panel is for the 2nd floor (201-224).  3rd patch panel are for 3rd floor 301-324, the 4th patch panel are for the 4th floor 401-424, and the 5th patch panel is the 5th floor 501-524.   ********************************************************************************************* ******** IN CASE OF FUSION FAILURE MOVE TRAFFIC OVER MIKROTIK ******* ********************************************************************************************** 1.

The property is divided into 3 basic areas: Cottages (DSL), Apartments (POE), Memory Support (POE).  FROM THE MDF: IDFs (Apartments & Memory Suppor  A new building with 15 Ruckus H500s was added (QUAY400). The IDF for this building is on the ground floor electrical closet. There is a fiber uplink from there to the trash room on the 1st floor and from there another fiber uplink to the MDF.  APARTMENTS UPGRADE The apartment section of this property was upgraded by putting h500s into every apartments unit. They were generally placed into the living room space. Old ZF7341 equipment was removed from the hallways. Network cables to specific rooms that were previously cut were repaired. HP switches were put into every IDF on each floor.  Spanning-Tree Protocol and BPDU-Protection (Guard) have been configured on the switches. This has been done to prevent users from connecting an unmanaged Switch to one of the Switches ports or even the h500 AP's ports.  GLEBE Cottages get their Internet uplink from the Quay 400 Building IDF.  The uplink SW is a Brocade 7250 in L3 mode, we are using the 8 fiber ports to feed the GLEBE 558-565 Buildings which is using 50/125 OM3 2M LC to LC.  The uplink for the Brocade is coming from the Bishop_Quay400-SW (HP2530-24P) on Port 24 to port 24 on the brocade SW.  GLEBE buildings 558-565 are feed via fiber from Bishop-Quay-BLDG400-SW-2.

DSLAMs are accessed through https://grandviewvegasnode1.hotelwifi.com: then put port forward - Marc 1/26/15  DSLAMs have a known bug wherein they will be up but not accessible via web interface or telnet and will not respond to SNMP (and therefore will show as down in Nagios). If you attempt to log into the web interface and receive an error message that simply says ""Network"" - it is due to this bug. A reboot of the DSLAM will fix the issue and Erick regularly reboots them when he is at the property performing maintenance. The issue is known and is being monitored so if this is seen the outage can be disregarded.

The network starts in the MDF with the Fusion, ZD1200, and Core Switch. There is a WAN switch that feeds the Fusion. There are IDFs on floors 3, 5-9, and 13 (R). The APs are all PoE WITH THE EXCEPTION of the Engineering Office AP on the LG level which could not be PoE power due to the distance of the cable run. This AP gets its connection from AP-Room-UGWmLockerRm AP's spare ethernet port. The Engineering Office AP gets power from a Ruckus power adapter plugged in the Chief Engineers Office.        It should be noted that the 5th floor Switch, SW-IDF-5-01, is up-linked on a fiber connection that goes through two 10/100 Fiber to Ethernet Converters. One of the Fiber Converters is in the MDF and the other is in a closet on the 4th floor. Since the Fiber Converter only runs at 100megs, its being proposed to replace it.       A second thing to be aware of is that their remote wireless A/C controllers (InnCom) are connected into the 8th floor IDF switch on VLAN860. In the photos you will note that there are small white boxes with pink cables next to the IDF switches. These InnCom wireless devices are powered from the Negear PoE switch on the 8th floor.","The ISP WAN feed comes from the Transbeam-GTT ISP fiber modem to a fiber junction box on the side of the rack in the MDF. From the fiber junction box single mode fiber cable goes to the fiber converter on the wall, by the rack. Cat5e cable going to the LAN-WAN SW (172.16.0.9), port 15 and feeds the network.   Rittenhouse consists of a hotel portion, floors 1,2,3,5,-9 and 13, and a resident portion on floors 4 and 14 up.    There is an underground garage that goes down several floors. The MDF is on what is call the ""Upper Garage (UG)"" which is the first level down below the Lobby level.        There are APs on the UG level to cover the staff areas. There is only one AP on a level lower than the UG level and that is the AP in the Engineering Office on the ""Lower Garage (LG)"" level. The R510 APs located on the LG and UG levels are located as follows: UG Level - Elevator Lobby UG Level - Security UG Level - Men's Locker Rm UG Level - Wemen's Locker Rm UG Level - MDF AP LG Level - Engineering Off        The MDF is next to the PSAV Office on the UG level. There is a Fusion, ZD1200, a Core Switch, and a WAN switch in the MDF.         The Lobby level (ground or 1st floor), 2nd floor Lacroix Restaurant, 3rd Floor SPA and Salon, have R510s covering public areas. These are located as follows:  LOBBY1 AP - Above the ceiling access panel near the door of the ""library"" leading into the Bar LOBBY2 AP - Above the ceiling access panel over the point of sale terminal for the Terrace Restaurant. LOBBY3 AP - Above the ceiling access panel where the stairs begin. LOBBY_BC  - In a cupboard in the Business Center. (This is currently being renovated) LOBBY_BehindFD - Its above the ceiling tiles in the front desk back office. 2nd Floor Lacroix - Above the ceiling tiles in the corner of the kitchen of the Lacroix restaurant. 3rd Floor SPA - In the ceiling tile just around the corner from the Salon front desk. 3rd Floor FitnessCt - Above the ceiling access panel in the middle of the Fitness Center room. 3rdLockerRmHall - Above the ceiling access panel just outside the door to the men's fitness center locker room in the hallway. 3rdHallSoffit_A - Above the soffit in the hallway outside the ""P"" rooms on the 3rd floor near the door to the service elevator lobby (IDF2 3rd Floor). 3rdHallSoffit_B - Above the soffit in the hallway outside the ""P"" rooms (specifically outside P2 guest room). 3rd Floor SPA_IDF1 - Above the ceiling tiles outside the 3rd floor IDF1, which is in the back-lines area. 3rd Floor 3rdMassageRms - Above the ceiling access panel just as you come into the massage rooms hallway. 3rd Floor Pool - Above the ceiling access panel just after you come into the pool area.     With the exception of the 3rd Floor IDF1 (SPA) Switch, which is located in the back-lines area of the 3rd floor, all of the IDFs are located in the Service Elevator lobbies on floors 3,5,6-9, and 13 (also called the ""R"" floor).       In the IDFs on the guest floors 5-9 and 13 (R), you will find two sets of switches. This is because there are two sets of network cables going to each room on these floors. There is one set of cables that go to a phone/cat5 jack plate near the desk in each room. These cables share a wire pair for the phone and the remaining pairs are punched down on separate a patch panel (from the AP patch panel) that is patched to a E2620-24 switch. These cables are not currently being used for APs and are only for a guest using their Laptop at the desk.          The second set of cables going to the rooms is Cat6 and goes to a network jack biscuit usually found behind the TV. These are the cables that the APs are connected to and these go to the second switch, a PoE switch, in the IDF.          Some of the IDFs have an R510 ( though there will also be an H320 put into the 8th floor IDF in the future) that covers staff access to wifi in these back-lines areas. These APs are located in these IDFs currently: 5thElevLobby 7thElevLobby 9thElevLobby 13thElevLobby       The remaining APs are in the guest rooms as listed here: P1 (3rd floor) P2 (3rd floor) P3 (3rd floor) P4 (3rd floor) P5 (3rd floor) 500 502 501 504 507 510 511 516 517 518 520 600 601 604 605 608 609 610 615 616 618 620 702 701 706 707 710 711 714 717 718 720 800 801 804 805 808 809 815 818 **816 (The Presidential Suite, room 816, is still under construction but an H320 will be install in this room eventually) 820 900 902 905 906 907 908 911 914 917 919 920 R3 R4 R5 R6 R7 R9 R10 R14 R12 R15     The only thing else to be aware of is that there are two PCs in the MDF connected to the SW-MDF-UG-02-LANWAN switch. One PC is for the InnCom system remote access AC controllers. The InnCom system - you will see the Netgear PoE switch on the 8th floor connecting all the wireless controller antennas on floors 5-13 - is a system that  wirelessly controls the AC units in the guest rooms. The InnCom siwtch on the 8th floor is connected into our switch on VLAN860.       The other PC in the MDF is for the PurpleCloud system. The PurpleCloud system is what is used for the Staff tablets for inter-hotel messaging. This PC is connected to the WAN side of SW-MDF-UG-02-LANWAN switch. ","a.) Per the Hirsha Rep only about 85% of the guest room cables that we installed the APs on were operational (ie, either not missing or damaged). Per what we found when installing the system,there are a few Guest Room APs where the cables were damaged and had to be rewired to get two working pairs. These APs must run at a static 100FDx in the IDF switches and the patch cables for the APs should stay on those ports on the switch (unless another port is configured for static 100FDx, ie, not ""Auto""). There are also a few guest room APs that are running at 100 on Auto which may also have cable issues but have at least two working pairs. The rooms where the cables were actually rewired are: AP-Room-517 (port 15, SW-IDF-5-01) AP-Room-907 (port 17, SW-IDF-9-01) AP-Room-919 (port 18, SW-IDF-9-01 b.) Note:Their SPA Music box is connected to SW-IDF2-3-01 IDF switch and is passed through the Fusion. c.) Note: Their InnCom wireless controller Netgear Switch is connected to port 2 on SW-IDF-8-01 d.) Note: There are two spares in the Chief Engineers Office. One is for the 8th floor IDF service elevator lobby. The other is for the Presidential Suite, 816, which is currently under renovations. Without these two APs, the Presidential Suite will not be covered.  Room 816 - Presidential Suite has Lutron-Lighting (VLAN 810) system. There is an iPad in the room and has to be connected to: SSID: Lutron-Lighting PW:  lu1r0n816      -        FYI in case if the Guest changing the SSID in the iPad settings. 2 Lutron-Lighting devices is hardwired on the SW-IDF-8-01 (172.16.0.16) Port:11 and 22     4 APs only broadcasting the SSID Room 717, 815, 818, 917 in AP group ""Room-816"".

Their onsite contact is Scott (scott@tiburontavern), otherwise can reach them through the GM, Gary. Initially, they installed a POS system called ""TOAST"" so they could use their handheld POS terminals in the restaurant only. The TOAST system installed consists of a Cisco GW, Core switch and two Ubiquity APs in the restaurant area. Recently, the restaurant decided they wanted coverage for their POS terminals on the 2nd floor patio (above the restaurant), the inside pool area patio and the pool itself. The IT company for Tiburon (CMIT Solutions of Central Rhode Island, contact: Zachary @ 401-586-6842), decided the best solution for these additional areas was to put the POS terminals SSID (TIBURON_TAVERN_SECURE, WPA2 PWD: toasty979931fa) on our APs that are facing the pool and patio areas. To do this, the TOAST Core switch port 14 is connected to Untagged VLAN 801 on port 10 on our Core switch (SW-MDF-1-01). VLAN 801 is TAG to the two switches (SW-IDF5-1-1 & SW-IDF6-2-1) that have APs covering the pool and patio areas. (their Cisco GW hands out this DHCP address pool: 192.168.192.xx/24 GW: 192.168.192.1). Currently, the TOAST SSID is deleted from the ZD due to the POS terminals are not getting out to the internet on our APs. The POS terminals can print to the kitchen locally but just cant get out to the internet via the TOAST GW - probably some blocking in the TOAST GW config.  WattBox Outlets Breakdown: 1.

The Fusion controls the network, and the wireless conroller is hisvsz2.hotelwifi.com. The property is managed by a special coworking management software called Nexudus.  The Colette Club SSID is setup for dynamic VLANs, with each office space having it's own dedicated VLAN, as determined by the static VTAs in the Fusion. When a user first connects, they are part of a general VLAN that contains all devices. Once they are associated to an office space, their accounts are switched to the dedicated VLAN for that particular space.  There are two types of network users: coworkers (or members), and visitors (or guests). Each authenticates on the network using a unique access code that is created in Nexudus. Property staff help each user get their access code. For members, the access code is called ""Internet access, check-in and printing pin-code."" This can be found in the Nexudus dashboard under Operations > Customers > Members & contacts > {Member Name} > Account > Access Rights. For guests, the access code is called ""Check-in code,"" and can be found under Operations > Customers > Visitors. The captive portal has an access code field, and checks the user's entry against both the member codes and the guest codes, and creates the applicable Account depending on which the user is. Member Accounts are valid for the length of time defined by the ""member_expiration_days"" CDK, which is currently set to 365 days. Guest Accounts are valid for the length of time defined by the ""user_expiration_days"" CDK, which is currently set to 1 day. Additionally, all guest accounts are purged nightly to avoid having a returning guest auto-added to an office space they are no longer visiting.  After either a member or a guest is authenticated, they are put in the generic VLAN. Members get associated to an office space when they have an active booking for a specific office in Nexudus. Nexudus hits an API on the Fusion every time a booking is created or updated, and the Fusion moves the applicable member's account into the VLAN for the applicable office space. Guests get associated to an office space by scanning a unique QR code displayed on a tablet in each space, or by manually navigating to the URL displayed on the tabled (http://wi.fi/portal/access/signin) and entering the unique code for that space, which is also displayed on the tablet. The code for each space changes daily so that a guest can't return on some other day and re-authenticate without being in front of the tablet in the room they are in.  ##### HIS's Coworking Space Solution Components: #####  There are several pieces to this new Coworking Space product, which will be described here:  - Integration from the Fusion Custom Portal template to Nexudus's API to validate the existence of a coworker or visitor using their ""Internet access, check-in and printing pin-code"" or ""Check-in code."" - Integration from the Fusion Custom Portal template to Nexudus's API to check for an active booking at the time a coworker is authenticating. - All Nexudus related functionality is included in the default Fusion Custom Portal template, including 10 new Custom Data Keys to configure the Nexudus integration: 	+ nexudus_login (which pairs with account_login to display the proper login form) 	+ nexudus_username (our username to authenticate against the Nexudus API, support@hotelwifi.com) 	+ nexudus_password (our password to authenticate against the Nexudus API, nH4zhl$Z!22I1U) 	+ member_account_group (the Account Group coworkers/members should be associated with, usually ""Nexudus"") 	+ member_expiration_days (the number of days a coworker/member account should be valid for, usually ""365"") 	+ user_account_group (the Account Group visitors/guests should be associated with, usually ""Nexudus_Visitor"") 	+ user_expiration_days (the number of days a visitor/guest account should be valid for, usually ""1"") 	+ nexudus_meeting_gracetime_minutes (the number of minutes before and after a booking period that the coworker/member devices get added to or removed from that booking's VLAN, usually ""5"") 	+ nexudus_meeting_purger_weeks (number of past weeks before which all booking records, which are stored in the Shared Credential Groups table, should be purged, usually ""2"") 	+ nexudus_location (the name of the location within Nexudus, in this case ""Colette"") - An API endpoint in the Fusion Custom Portal template (https://{Fusion DNS}/portal/access/nexudus_booking) that Nexudus hits each time a booking is created or updated. The Fusion stores each new booking in the Shared Credential Groups table. In Nexudus, this endpoint is configured under Settings > Show advanced settings > Integrations > Webhooks. The two webhooks we have configured are ""Fusion - Booking Created"" and ""Fusion - Booking Updated"". - An API endpoint in the Fusion Custom Portal template (https://{Fusion DNS}/portal/access/nexudus_qr?room={Nexudus room name}) that each in-room tablet hits and receives a JSON object containing a qr_url, display_url, and code. - A form in the Fusion Custom Portal template (https://{Fusion DNS}/portal/access/nexudus_booking/signin) that can be hit by scanning the in-room tablet's QR code, or manually navigated to and the unique code can be entered in. - The Fusion's Accounts, PMS Guests, PMS Rooms, and VLAN Tag Assignments tables to manage Nexudus office spaces and coworker/visitor accounts - The Fusion's Shared Credential Groups table to store the information on all bookings, including: Booking Unique ID, Office Space Name, Coworker ID, Booking From Time, and Booking To Time - A Fusion Backend Script to pull all office space locations via Nexudus's API and create a PMS Room and Account for each space. This automates the installation process by automatically adding all office spaces at the click of a button. This script also runs every day to add any new spaces if any are configured within Nexudus (prior to any new space functioning with the dynamic VLAN functionality, a static VTA will need to be created for the new space). - A Fusion Backend Script that runs every minute, looking at the SCG table for any bookings that have started and moving the applicable coworker account into the correct PMS Room for that booking. - A Fusion Backend Script that runs every 5 minutes, looking at the SCG table for any bookings that have ended and moving the applicable coworker account back into the ""General"" PMS Room.  - A Fusion Backend Script that runs at the end of each day and deletes all visitor/guest Accounts and PMS Guests, as well as moves any coworkers who scanned an in-room QR to manually join space back into the ""General"" PMS Room. - A Fusion Backend Script that runs every day and which purges all bookings from the SCG table that expired earlier than the number of weeks set in the nexudus_meeting_purger_weeks CDK.  ##### Configuration Dependencies #####  In addition to the components above, there are critical items of configuration in both the Fusion and SmartZone.  # Fusion: - All of the standard configuration to support dynamic VLANs must be in place: 	+ A WLAN Controller 	+ A RADIUS Server Option that has the SmartZone whitelisted 	+ A Pre-Auth RADIUS Server Realm with the applicable SSID as the Called-Station_Id attribute, set to per-Device 	+ A Post-Auth RADIUS Server Realm linked to the Policy in which all coworker/visitor accounts will be contained, set to per-Room 	+ Account Groups for members and visitors that match the member_account_group and user_account_group CDKs 	+ A Policy, or Policies, for these Account Groups 	+ Static VLAN Tag Assignments for every PMS Room, assigning the applicable VLAN to each office space, as well as to the pre-auth PMS Rooms (General and User) 	+ A General PMS Room in which member Accounts are placed when they do not have a booking 	+ A User PMS Room in which visitor Accounts are placed when they have not scanned an in-room QR 	(NOTE: The General and User PMS Rooms can be assigned the same VLAN if network segmentation between the two types of users is not required) - The Pre-Auth VLAN DHCP Pool needs to have default-lease-time, max-lease-time, and min-lease-time DHCP Options set to ""30"" - A DNS Record of wi.fi needs to be in place. This record is automatically configured in any Fusion that has been newly installed in the past several years.  # SmartZone: The WLAN must have this configuration, in addition to any other standard configuration: - Method: MAC Address - Authentication Service: On, and the Fusion selected as the RADIUS Server - Accounting Service: On, and the Fusion selected as the RADIUS Server (RADIUS CoA on VTA change will not work without this) - RADIUS Options > NAS IP: User-defined and set to IP of SmartZone - Enable Dynamic VLAN (AAA Override): On  ##### Special Mentions ##### - Colette has two office types, Huddle Rooms and Enclaves, which do not have any shared network resources, therefore, any booking for these spaces are ignored (as hard-coded in the ""Nexudus Booking Start Check"" Backend Script), and we do not need static VTAs for these spaces. - If a member books two or more spaces simultaneously, their Account bill be placed in the PMS Room that happens to show up last in the list. If the member wishes their device(s) to be part of one of their other spaces, they need to scan the QR code in that room, following the same process a vistor would.  ##### How to View Nexudus API Endpoints #####  It's quite easy to look at the information returned by Nexudus via any of their APIs that we use. The full documentation on their API is contained here: https://developers.nexudus.com/reference/getting-started-with-your-api-1. All of the APIs we use are contained under the ""REST API REFERENCE"" section.  You can use a browser to check any endpoint we use, which could be helpful in troubleshooting. All you need are our credentials for Nexudus and the below endpoints:  To search for a coworker by their email address: https://spaces.nexudus.com/api/spaces/coworkers?page=1&size=25&Coworker_Email=applicable@email.address.com  To search for a coworker by their access code: https://spaces.nexudus.com/api/spaces/coworkers?page=1&size=25&Coworker_AccessPincode=ACCESSCODE  To search for a user by their email address: https://spaces.nexudus.com/api/sys/users?page=1&size=25&User_Email=applicable@email.address.com  To search for a visitor by their email address: https://spaces.nexudus.com/api/spaces/visitors?page=1&size=25&Visitor_Email=applicable@email.address.com  To search for visitors expected on a certain date: https://spaces.nexudus.com/api/spaces/visitors?page=1&size=25&from_Visitor_ExpectedArrival=YYYY-MM-DDT01:00&to_Visitor_ExpectedArrival=YYYY-MM-DDT23:00 (Note: This endpoint is used to find visitors by their access code. Nexudus' API to search the visitors table directly by access code is broken, so we first pull all visitors expected that day, and then iterate through each visitor and check their access code against what was entered in the captive portal.)  To search for bookings for a specific coworker on a specific day:  https://spaces.nexudus.com/api/spaces/bookings?page=1&size=25&Booking_Coworker=COWORKERID&from_Booking_FromTime=YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00&to_Booking_ToTime=YYYY-MM-DDT23:59:00"") (Note: To find the coworker ID, you can either look at the ""Address 2"" field in their Account in the Fusion, or use the above coworkers endpoint to find the correct coworker by their email address. If you only have the coworkers name, and not their email, you can look them up by name in the Nexudus GUI under Operations > Customers > Members & contacts, and their ID might be under Account > Identifiers > Tag. If it's not there, you can find their email address under Account > Account Details and use the coworkers API above to find their ID. There are a lot of different IDs in each coworker record, you want the one that is simply ""Id"".)  To search for all office spaces: https://spaces.nexudus.com/api/sys/floorplandesks?page=1&size=50",,"##### No Longer Receiving New Bookings #####  If the Fusion is no longer receiving booking notifications from Nexudus (no new SCGs are being created for each booking), this means the Webhook in Nexudus has been disabled. Nexudus tries a webhook 10 times, and if it fails (could fail due to a timeout, if the Fusion goes offline, or a fatal 500 error, if the custom portal code is broken), it automatically disables that webhook, and it needs to be manually reactivated.   To investigate the cause of the disabling, and to reactivate the webhooks, navigate to Settings > Show advanced settings > Integrations > Webhooks in the Nexudus GUI. The two webhooks we have configured are ""Fusion - Booking Created"" and ""Fusion - Booking Updated"". You can see their status, Active or Disabled, right in the list. If they are disabled, click on the name of the webhook and look at the ""Last error"" field. Whatever it says will need to be resolved before reactiviting the webhook, or it will just fail again. After you have resolved the issue, switch the ""Active"" toggle to on and save changes. Do this for each disabled webhook.  ##### Issues with the Captive Portal #####  To investigate issues with the captive portal, including log in issues, QR code retreival issues from the in-room tablets, QR code scan issues, and issues with receiving bookings, navigate to Archives > .log Files > HTTP (prod) and search for HISLog in the ""Filter field"" [use HTTP (dev) if the Fusion is running in development mode]. To look at log messages live, SSH into the Fusion and run ""tfpro | grep HISLog"" (or ""tfdev | grep HISLog"" if in development mode).  ##### Issues with Backend Scripts/Notification Actions #####  To investigate issues with any Backend Scripts, the first place to look is Output column under Services > Notifications > Backend Scripts. This will show you the output the last time the script ran. A couple of these scripts run every 1 to 5 minutes, so that gets overwritten quite frequently. If you need to look at more historical data, each Backend Script includes data on how to search for that scripts logs, such as ""go to Archives > .log Files > Background Jobs and Filter by 'Nexudus Booking'""","Fusion: https://colette.hotelwifi.com/admin  WAN1(VLAN 901) : 148.76.97.141/28 Default GW: 148.76.97.129 1 Gbps/1 Gbps  WAN 2 IPv4 (VLAN 902): 38.104.173.165/29 Default GW: 38.104.173.161 DNS: 66.28.0.61, 66.28.0.14, 66.28.0.30 WAN2 IPv6 (VLAN 902): 2001:550:2:a::224:5/112 Default GW: 2001:550:2:A::224:1 DNS: 2001:550:1:1::d, 2001:550:1:2::d, 2001:550:1:a::d, 2001:550:1:b::d 100 Mpbs/100 Mbps  + vSZ: https://hisvsz2.hotelwifi.com:8443/ ",,,,,,,,,,0,8/19/2022,2/17/2025,E0BC07BD-4588-4661-849D-6FA294A6EC88

This is similar to a traditional Cluster + Nodes setup with some additions.   Physical hardware: Like any HA setup this setup has more than 1 physical machines for Fusions for redundancy purposes. This particular cluster has 2 physical Dell R640 servers on-site. Each R640 has Fusion Cluster Controller and 2 Nodes installed on it. This is done using VMWare ESXi. There is also a third machine (that will be a physical machine in the future) that will carry 1 functions of what is called a Witness Node. Witness Node funtion is not to route traffic, but to participate in a quorum to determine which Cluster (CC + Nodes) will be the working cluster.  CC: In this setup there are 2 Cluster Controllers (CC) - Primary and Secondary. CCs constantly sync databases between each other. If one CC goes down, the other will take over and the setup will continue working. for the sake of differentiation we call CC-A the primary Cluster Controller and CC-B the secondary Cluster Controller.  Nodes: There are 4 nodes that route traffic (just like traditional setup) and  a new Node that we call Witness. Witness node (eventually) will be located on a separate hardware. It is a Fusion that does no guest traffic routing. It is simply there to witness the failure and participate in a fail-over process as a voting machine (witness of the failing cluster).",,Radius is enabled for the switches 06/25/2020 Loews Hollywood Hotel SW-LHHSW01-Annex IP 10.7.253.55 was removed from the location and disabled it on Nagios.

Hubb is Putting them in)  Out-of-Scope Action Items: •	Install all required data cable from the appropriate rooms to pre-designated IDFs. •	Install all required cable from the 1st floor IDF to all other IDFs.    La Plage:  Installation Plan:  This building will get its feed via SM fiber from the MDF. Fiber from MDF terminates on 2nd floor Network Closet. From there we will need to do VDSL to Every Room on the 1st and 4th floors. We will be installing 2 AP’s per room. One AP will go in the Main Bedroom and the other AP will go in the living room. The AP in the Bedroom will receive the VDSL Signal. From there we will be coming out of the AP with a small patch cable that goes into a POE injector. From there we will need to run a Cat 5 cable coming out of the POE out port through a conduit that goes from the Bedroom to the Living room. Per Hubb this conduit already exists. Hubb wants us to ensure that we have a nice looking box for each room to put all of the Bedroom Equipment in. There are 28 rooms on floors 1 and 4. 4 is a bit smaller than 1, but the rooms are bigger. So I am taking the 2nd floor and doubling it. We may have to move a few AP’s from the 4th floor to cover the 3rd floor because this building tapers from top to bottom.   Note: This Building has an interesting floor layout. It goes:  Ground Floor 1st Floor – AP’s will go on this Floor 2nd Floor 3rd Floor 4th Floor – AP’s will go on this Floor 5th Floor   La Plage Equipment List:  (1)	HP ProCurve 2530-24G-PoE+ Switch (J9773A) (1)	10m LC/SC Single-Mode Fiber Patch Cable        (112) 7352 AP’s        (56)  SMC VDSL 2 CPE’s        (3)  SMC VDSL 2 Switches         (3)  66 Blocks         (3) 20 Foot Amphonal Cables.

La Terrace: This building will get its feed via SM fiber from the MDF. Fiber from MDF terminates In basement Network Closet. From there will we need to feed all AP’s via POE. They have cat 5 cable to each room. Currently one pair is being used. We will need to make a male end, plug that into our switch and on the other end will need to punch down to a 110 block in the IDF. From there we will need to go to room and take two pairs and punch it down to a female jack. From the Female jack we will feed AP with a white patch cable. We will need to have 2 outdoor AP’s that will run Back to the IDF. Cable is already there.

There is a section called Passphrase once you are editing the WLAN, and that is where the WPA2 key is changed.  There is poor cell phone reception (not wifi) in this building.  If a resident calls in complaining that they are having problems with making calls on their cell phone then they should be instructed to enable wifi calling on their phone, and to connect to the SSID that is in their unit.  If caller already has their phone on WiFi calling and gets dropped often, have them set their phones on Airplane Mode, turn wifi on and connect to their SSID.

The default IP configuration is Carrier Grade Network Address Translation (CGNAT) using private address space assigned to Starlink clients with DHCP from the 100.64.0.0/10 network.  Network Address Translation (NAT) translates between Starlink private and public IPs.  The Starlink public IP policy is an optional configuration available to Business and Maritime customers. A public IP is reachable from any device on the internet and is assigned to Starlink network clients using DHCP. Moving the Starlink to another location may cause the public IP to change. Starlink does not currently offer the ability for Residential or Roam customers to receive a public IP. The public IP option can be enabled from the account dashboard.  Each Starlink is allocated one IPv4 address and delegated a /56 IPv6 prefix for network clients. All Starlink network clients are assigned an IPv6 address if the router is IPv6 is capable. IPv6 is not supported on the early generation router in the Circular Starlink Kit.  The default IP policy using CGNAT blocks all inbound ports. Customers requiring inbound ports should consider products with a public IP option. The following outbound ports are blocked for all customers per information security best practices: TCP/25 (SMTP) and TCP/445 (SMB).  As Starlink continues to expand and upgrade our global internet service infrastructure and rollout new capabilities, some users may see different IP address behavior (for example, publicly routable addresses, IPv6, non-CGNAT).  v.

Use Winbox software to log into the Mikrotik 68.116.54.246 (admin/GsquidPineapplejelly7&) 2. From the Mikrotik ssh into Core SW, run: ""system ssh 172.16.55.10 user=admin"" ----- and use the PW: SsquidPineapplejelly7& 3. Once on the CoreSW, disable the SW port when the Fusion LAN2 is (1/1/20) to ensure it won't be traffic over the Fusion. 4. Enable all the VLANs under the Interfaces menu under the VLAN tab. 5. On the IP menu, select the submenu Addresses, then select the interface ""Mgmt-172.16.55.1/24-VLAN100"" and change the IP address from 172.16.55.2/24 to 172.16.55.1/24 6. Select the submenu DHCP Server on the IP menu and enable all the DHCP servers. Notes: - These are the VLANs currently configured in the Mikrotik: Admnin-Staff VLAN202, Conference VLAN300, Guest-WiFi VLAN200, Mgmt-172.16.55.1/24-VLAN100, Premium-Guest VLAN201 -In case a local connection is needed on the Mikrotik, please use ETH5/Local, make your PC static on 192.168.88.100/24, then type this IP 192.168.88.1 on the browser.  Admin-Network: --------------------- They have an Admin network mostly running on Vlan1, for IP-Phones, wireless computers and register machines. We created a Dry vlan800 in our Guest-Network to interconnect the Admin-Network.... We had to do this configuration to keep alive their wireless devices since the old Cisco APs used to broadcast SSIDs for both (Guest and Admin), all the Cisco APs were disconnected from their SWs.

This can be done by SSHing to the CMTS and running the ""show cable modem phy"" command.  If the output does not provide a USSNR (dB) column but only returns one or two MAC addresses then the CMTS should be rebooted.  After the reboot give the CMTS about 15 minutes and then run the ""show cable modem phy"" command again.  The SNR should now be shown.  The cable modems that connect to the CMTS in building B (the Pace CMTS at 172.16.0.19) need a config file called config3.cfg which they pull from the Fusion via tftp. This file in saved in the backups section on the docs tab here in the CRM. If the modems are not able to get this file then they will stay in the init(o) state which can be viewed from the CLI of the cmts using the ""show cable modem"" command. I had to reload this file into the Fusion after doing a backup restore because the backup did not contain the config3.cfg file in the tftp directory. -Walter 5/31/24  If the Blonder Tongue CMTS is reset to factory a config file needs to be loaded into the CMTS in addition to re entering the configuration. The file on the Docs tab in the CRM called D_full_255.cfg is the config file that needs to be loaded. There is also a backup of the config saved on the Docs tab. The factory default IP of the CMTS is 192.168.168.100. I have given the Fusion an IP in that subnet so that if the CMTS is reset to factory we should be able tor each the CMTS via the CLI. -Walter 8/29/24","Fusion IP: 192.183.87.194 Mask:255.255.255.248 DG: 192.183.87.193  Fusion IPMI: 192.183.87.197  WPS IP: 192.183.87.196 World Cinema IP: 192.183.87.198  Fusion: https://foxriverresort.hotelwifi.com/admin  SZ: https://foxriverresort.hotelwifi.com:60002 ALL APs in buildings E,F,G,H,I,L & M are powered down APs in building A-O are controlled by CMTS1 .19 switch APs in building Q-Z are CMTS 2 .20 switch WattBox http://192.183.87.196/",Contact #: 24/7 support at 888-637-9620  Account/Circuit ID:  : 30L1XN659637FTNC Escalation steps: Follow the prompts when calling into the 888 number to open a ticket.

If the PtoP still has power, Nagios can access the PtoP through the meshed AP which makes it look at first that the PtoP links are up. Use the GUI on the PtoP to verify.   Also, in the last 4 years, the hose clamps holding the PtoPs to the poles rushed and broke. The PtoPs then went out of alinement. Always have engineering check if the PtoP is pointing in the right direction when suspicious of a linking problem between PtoPs.

PSAV creates SSID in the conference tool (it must be active before you can do anything!) 2. They call us to add the SSID they have setup. In order to know which SSID to add, they need to provide the SSID name. 3. Go to Smartzone-> Wireless LANs -> Conference Zone -> default 4. Check if the SSID exists. Also, get the VLAN 5. Go to Smartzone-> Wireless LANs -> Default Zone -> Guest/Conference 6. Create same SSID with the same name and VLAN as the one they reported (can be checked under Conference Zone) 5.

During renovations, the furniture in all rooms was changed which made the TV coax cable jack no longer in the right position to connect to the new TV mounting locations. Four of these rooms still need a major handling by the general contractor to get the TV cable over to the new TV location in the room. Those rooms are: 204, 210,218,302 -Also, there is a TV channel issue in 306 and 312 where the higher number channels don't show due to weak signal. Room 306 doesn't show channels 72 to 86.

VLAN 10 is the interconnect VLAN between the Fusion and the core switch**** RPR AND SFR APs ARE MANAGED THROUGH THIS FUSION****  The hardware in Visio (HA Fusion Diagram) shows what is needed in order to support a High Availability V12000 Fusion Cluster. The hardware consists of 2 computing Nodes (Main and Backup), Storage Server (SAN)  The Main Nodes are Dell R940 Blade Servers with 4xCPU in each and 250+GB RAM. They connect to SAN storage using SAS 12Gbps Cables. There are 2 SAS cables connected from each of the Nodes to SAN. Each SAS cable connects to a separate motherboard on the SAS.   This is a High Availability Cluster. This means if one Node, either Primary or Backup goes down, the Fusion VMs will boot up and will be ready to go on the other (working node) within couple of minutes.

Property had existing Ruckus WiFi and wired room connections. Property did not supply full documentation.  Each wired connection is on a separate VLAN, which equates to 1339 VLANs. There are also 16 Wireless VLANs - One for each of the three guest towers, eight for the common areas around their convention spaces, four for guest villas, and one for the pool and lobby area.  There is a vendor, SPA, that uses the Internet connection as well. They are on their own VLAN and they are not sent to a portal page.  The Pool AP has a ""Cabana"" WLAN with ZD Guest Pass authentication, so the subnet for that WLAN is passed through the Fusion portal page.  The property PMS is Agilysys' Visual One. We are interfaced with them through a Comtrol interface.","We were not provided property maps showing exact locations of devices.  The Fusion, backup Fusion, Buena Vista Suites and the core switch for all of these are located in the MDF at Caribe Royale."," ***For suspected ISP outages an email should be sent to mis@cariberoyale.com explaining to them why you think there is an ISP issue (for example we lost access to all gateways).  If there is no response to this email within 10 minutes then it is okay to contact the ISP.  If the outage resolves then a follow up email must be sent to mis@cariberoyale.com letting them know that the network is now back online.  Windstream should also be contacted again letting them know that we now have access to the equipment*** - Walter 6/5/19  A Cluster controller was added to this property this week. So now both Fusion are handling traffic simultaneously. Both Fusions have active DHCP service which ever response first to the request will get the session. All the configuration could be done from the cluster controller. At this point only the wireless VLANs were added to the backup Fusion. So if the primary Fusion goes down there would not be hardwired connections. Here is how you access the cluster controller:  When a guest calls for WiFi related issues and you are not able to resolve he issue, send an email to helpdesk@cariberoyale.com so one of the techs can assist the guest. Local IT phone # 407-238-8066.  From Caribe IT Dept Added 5/16/2017: ""Please inform your staff that in some support cases we are installing these Linksys additional access points to eliminate customer complaints and usually only after we have been contacted.  There will only be three SSIDs. “ Tower1”, “Tower2” or” Tower3” coinciding with the tower that the guest is staying in.

The meshed AP's are plugged into the power for the camp sites. So guests or staff might turn the power off without realizing it.  This is a Ubiquiti network with a CloudKey controller. Therefore any changes to the network need to be done through the Cloudkey via GUI.  ***P2P bridges are not controlled by the CloudKey*** Pool IDF has a lot of corrosion due to the pool and the chemicals.

Access the Menu: Press the ""Menu"" or ""Home"" button on your RCA TV remote.  2.	Navigate to Settings: Use the arrow keys on your remote to find and select the ""Settings"" or ""System"" option.  3.	Locate HDMI-CEC: Look for a setting related to HDMI, such as ""HDMI Control,"" ""CEC,"" ""EasyLink,"" or similar.  4.

Here is how it is setup: There are 2 ISP modems each with unique WAN and LAN public IP blocks.  One of those modems connects directly to the Fusion on WAN 2 and the other connects directly to the EdgeRouter on eth0.  The EdgeRouter acts as the default gateway for the admin network and for several devices on our network (Fusion WAN 2 and IPMI).  Refer to the diagram on the docs tab labeled ""Ramada by Wyndham Tucson Public IP Data Hotel Admin Network"" for details on how the admin network is connected to Cox.  The Gem Show Every year they have a gem show at the property and we come out to help support the setup and troubleshoot any issues that arise. Only vendors are staying at the property. There are no guests.  Work they do: The local staff does all the physical setup. Running cables, mounting/connecting switches and AP.   Work we do: Confirming all the equipment is connected and running correctly, all AP's are broadcasting and have good throughput. Assist staff and vendors with connection issues. Several vendors will setup cameras and credit card machines and may need assistance with getting them setup.  Vendor security cameras with hardline connections are setup on the guest hardline VLAN 250. All other vendor devices are on the Gem Show EXHIBITOR SSID. Their cameras are cloud based so they just need internet access to use them.   Upload speeds are often maxed out. Management has been informed about this and understands that this affects the speeds of the network. Hopefully they will upgrade their upload speeds for the next show.  The Edgerouter4 is configured to act as the backup router incase there are any issues with the Fusion.  IF FUSION FAILS, MOVE TRAFFIC OVER TO EDGEROUTER: ------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1. Connect to the EdgeRouter using your web browser. 2.

The TV is controlled by the FMA controller with Dish, the channel line up and the configuration of the TV model is being pushed to the TV.  The TV does not accept direct input from the guest cast remote button because the FTG on the TV is in MPI/EBL mode.  Dan is working with World Cinema on getting that corrected, I have created the TLX file with a channel lineup for the two LG TV models in the INN and is stored in CRM.   The is the issue that was found at the property pertaining the Dish headend:  3.	I found the issue with the TV at the Edgewater and the Inn, the dish headend here at both hotels have a controller that holds all the tv information. This controller puts all the TV’s in MPI-FTG mode and this is what is causing all our issues. For us to use a direct button input the TV needs to be in CPU-FTG mode which means the TV will need to have a file (FMA/TLX) that the channel lineup would be installed and then the TV will be able to control these features like HDMI inputs. The way it is now the Dish headend controls those features, so if we cannot by pass this controller the Guest cast remotes will not work correctly. I have tested this theory and I am correct. so what I did was remove the coax from the TV and then did a factory reset on the TV. Once done I looked at the Mode of the FTG and it was changed to CPU-FTG, at that point I was able to use a new guest cast remote and change the input for casting and for live tv. everything worked like it was supposed to. Here is the kicker, when I reconnected the coax cable to the TV and turned it back on the TV the controller at the dish headend reinstalled the file of the TV back to what it was before. Now the Guest cast remote no longer works like it was supposed to do. So the only way we can change the input is to program the casting and live tv button to open the input menu and the  guest will need to select the input they want to use, so the issue is not with the remotes it has to do with Dish network controller.

During renovations over that last 2 years, conduit for network connection was installed under the parking lots to connect each of the buildings. A fiber ""ring"" was created going from the MDF to Bldg K (10s rooms), then to Bldg J (20s rooms), Bldg I (30s rooms), and finally to Bldg F (60s rooms). From each of these key locations, Cat6 links fan out to the remainder of the buildings.       The MDF has two ZDs. The original ZD1000 still controls two 2942s in Bldg L which was not part of the renovations. The new ZD1100 controls the remainder of the APs on the property.        The MDF has a Fusion and Core Switch. The Core Switch has GBIX fiber link to Bldg K. There are a total of 12 IDFs with HP 2530 8port PoE switches. Each guest building has 3 to 5 APs in the attic for coverage of the guest rooms.         Of note is that the Business Center AP goes through and existing Netgear 8 port switch back to the MDF Core switch. The VIP Rooms (700s rooms) IDF switch also goes through a non-manged D-Link switch back to the MDF Cores Switch.        There is a P2P link from bldg K to the SPA building where there is one AP. This consists of two Ubiq. NanoBeam P2Ps. The NanoBeam sender (Access pt.) in Bldg K is mounted outside under the roof overhang and cable goes into the attic to the Bldg K IDF Switch.         Recently four new T310s were added to cover the restaurant, its patio, and the GMs office. These four APs are running on Unleashed software as the ZD1100 wont support the T310s.         Lastly, AP-GM-Office T310 is powered from the IDF I Backbone switch. This switch in Bldg I that is specifically there to provide a connection for the AV Camera guys. The GM's new AP was added to this switch.    Recently, GuestCast was installed and has a GuestCast sever installed in the MDF.","    Of note is that the staff refer to the buildings by the room number range. This can be confusing so you will see in all of my documentation that I also give each building a ""letter"" designation where the Lobby Building is letter ""A"". If i refer to a building I also give the room number range as well.     The APs for the guest rooms are located in the attics of each of the 12 buildings. There are attic access hatches in the hallways or from a closet or electrical closet. The few APs that are not located in the attic are in the Lobby building. There is one 7055 mounted on a jack in the Aldelucia II ballroom, one R500 under the desk in the Business Center (Lobby), and one R700 in the MDF.          There is a NanoBeam P2P sender that connects the SPA building (Bldg ""M"") to the 10s (Bldg ""K"") Switch . Its located just out side of the Pool Building (Bldg ""K"") under the roof overhang. The receiver Station is in the out door pump/filtration room of the SPA Building itself.            The majority of the IDF switches are also located in the building attics. The few that are not are the Maint. Office IDF Switch which is in the water heater room back of the tool shed and the Bldg F (60s rooms) IDF Switch which is located in the basement water heater room of that building (mounted on the wall).            There are four key IDF switches that form the Fiber ring for the property in Bldgs K, J, I and F. The Fiber ring connects through conduit links under the parking lots (there are manhole covers where the conduit can be accessed in the parking lot).            Here are the room locations over which the APs are located in the attics or specifically in the Lobby locations mounted on walls or under desks (as in the BC): Rm 230  Rm 233  Rm 235 Rm 237 Rm 239 Rm 240  Rm 242 Rm 244 Rm 245 Rm 119 (IDF access panel) Pool Rm 116 Rm 226 Rm 224 Rm 222 Rm 271 Rm 275 Rm 278 Rm 253 Bldg G (50s rooms) bldg center attic Rm 250 Rm 260 Rm262 Rm264 Rm 521 Rm 523 Rm 525 Rm 527 Rm 285 Rm 283 Rm 281 Rm 295 Rm 292 Rm 292/295 attic center of Bldg Rm 293/294 attic center between rooms MDF Lobby Business Center  Rm 701 Rm 704 Rm 705 Andalucia II Meeting Rm (on wall) SPA bldg Staff Office attic (access in closet)      The MDF can be accessed from an outside door approximately at the back of the Adelucia I ballroom. Its part of the Lobby/Ballroom complex I called Bldg A.      There are three T310s covering the Restaurant and its patio. The patio AP is on the roof of the MDF. The other two T310s are on the restaurant roof. Lastly, there is a T310 mounted on the side of the 30's Bldg (I), that is mounted directly over the GMs office.   ","Ping Watchdog is running on the P2Ps. Please refer to the document ""P2P Ping Watchdog Notes Casa Munras"" in the Network Diagram section of Docs.  Note that there are four new T310s installed. These four new APs are running on Unleashed software since the ZD1100 can not be upgraded to the proper level of firmare to run the T310s. The Master is currently 172.20.0.50.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------- IF FUSION FAILS, MOVE TRAFFIC OVER MIKROTIK: ------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1. Use Winbox software to log into the Mikrotik 64.60.124.6 (admin/GsquidPineapplejelly7&) 2. From the Mikrotik ssh into Core SW, run: ""system ssh 10.5.5.10 user=admin"" ----- and use the PW: lib3rty 3. Once on the CoreSW, disable the SW port when the Fusion LAN1 (18) and LAN2 (19) to ensure it won't be traffic over the Fusion. 4. Enable all the VLANs under the Interfaces menu under the VLAN tab. 5. Enable the interface ETH2/LAN under the Interfaces menu under the Interface tab. 6. On the IP menu, select the submenu Addresses, then select the interface ""ETR3/MGMT"" and change the IP address from 10.5.5.254/24 to 10.5.5.1/24 7. Select the submenu DHCP Server on the IP menu and enable all the DHCP servers. Notes: - These are the VLANs currently configured in the Mikrotik: Chromecast-VLAN500, Guest-WiFi-VALN200, GuestCast-MGMT-VLAN100, Menuvative-LAN300, Staff-WiFi-VLAN800   -------------------------------------------------------------- WAN DEVICES AND CONNECTIONS -------------------------------------------------------------- They have a 500meg fiber line coming in from Comcast. It goes to a fiber-to-eth modem in the MDF.  A single gray patch cable goes from the Comcast fiber modem to a white “TPX” box (Velocaloud). This TPX box converts a single Public IP from the Comcast Fiber Modem to another set of public addresses. The Fusion gets its WAN feed off of this white TPX box, which is why the Comcast public IP doesn’t match the Fusion for a WAN feed.  The hotel installed the white TPX box because the TPX has a backup failover 10mbps cellular feed (the smaller white box on top). However, that 10mps cell feed was designed only for voice, and having the guest Fusion connected means that if Comcast goes down, the Fusion itself will eat up all the bandwidth on that backup cell feed.

The demo involves bypassing GPON technology and routing IPTV through the APs. The APs, equipped with a Ruckus fiber backpack (media converter), are connected via fiber to a switch located in the IDF. The following additions were made to the network:  - An ICX7550 switch (IP: 10.7.0.11) was installed on the 3rd floor IDF. This switch (port 1/1/23) is connected to the core switch (port 1/1/12). - Two existing APs, namely AP-Room 301 and AP-Room 303, are utilized in this demo. These APs were relocated from their original AP groups in the Default Zone to the Demo Zone on the controller. - Additionally, one new AP (AP-334) was incorporated into the network. This AP has been assigned to the Demo Zone on the controller.  _____________________________________________________________________________________ --Octuber, 2025--- After the network upgrade in Otuber, 2025, an H350 was installed in every room.

In a nutshell... it means the channel line up and all the configuration for the TVs come from FMA through the coax, They are MPI mode, impossible to change any configuration on them, impossible to flash them, also making the ""Cast"" Key and ""TV"" Key in the remote non-functional.  The good news is we got access to the FMA and some configuration were done on it, like adding channel 58 as a bridge to HDMI 1 where the Chromecast is plugged in.  All this results in a Macro Function for ""Cast"" key on the remote: 5+8.  What happen with different LG TV models? We found some other TVs: (xxLY560H, xxLX560H) FMA not supported.

Login into the Mikrotik using WinBox Software. 2. Go over: Interfaces/Ethernet 3. Double Click on LAN/Eth2 and enable the Interface, then Apply. 4. At this moment you can have access to the core SW via SSH through the Mikrotik. 5. Do ssh on the CoreSW (172.17.0.10) through the Mikrotik. 6. Disable the port on CoreSW for Fusion LAN. 7. Verify you are getting ARP and check with someone onsite that the WiFi services is working.   IDF switches at this property are prone to overheating.  When they are overheating the PoE usually stops working.  This can be solved by cleaning the switches. Please contact Shawn at 646-393-7827, the cause is that the Laundry shoot is next to the IDF and the fans get clogged with Lint.

We are only providing Layer 2 for this SSID and passing it to the admin network via untagged VLAN 805 port 44 on the core switch (10.20.28.10) to their firewall.  In addition, there is no DHCP server on our Layer 2 segment, so any devices connecting to this network will need a static IP provided by Edge.  Van Owens is a good POC for this. vowens@edgecommunications.com  Note, aireus is a POS system replacing micros. Do not use this VLAN for anything else. There are also a few standalone Ruckus APs for the pool area. They are aware that roaming will not work the same in this area.  The standalone APs are attached to the 10.20.28.10 switch.    Below is the IP mapping for the aireus POS system. We do not control these IPs, this was provided by Van Owens at Edge. This is just for informational purposes.  At the time of this note the 2 mini iPADs are the only devices using the aireus SSID.

Also, when I left, their original network was still running due to the fact that they will be un-installing all the new APs to do renovations in the rooms. So there is a separate SSID coming from older APs (starting with Expo...) still being broadcasted. The Chf of Maint., Ramon, has been hatted on how to reinstall the APs but likely he will have problems.      Most of the rooms have two phone extensions running to them that are on separate cables/pairs and have separate extension numbers.

Do not change SSID setup if you do not fully understand it. It is there for a reason. 2920 switches cannot support more than 256 VLAN symotaniously, so we are tunneling per account dynamic VLANs to public spaces via 2920 core switch.  2530s on the other hand can support up to 512 VLANs.

The ISP comes into port 1; the Guest Node, Convention Node and Cluster Controller are on ports 2-4; ports 10 & 12 are for hotel use.   Ports 5-7 are on VLAN 1501 and are for the cluster communication between the controller and nodes. All other ports are for either the convention LAN or guest LAN and are on their respective VLANs (see equipment list).  There are three Fusions at this location. One acts as a controller and houses all of the databases and configuration for its nodes. There are two nodes; one is for the guest network and one is for the convention network.  The guestroom switches (Ciscos) are located in IDFs on specific floors as outlined in the network documentation. The switches feed the wired room connections as well as all access points. The switches are not PoE; PoE injectors power all APs. The wireless network is Ruckus. The Guest WLAN is assigned VLAN 2. VLAN 2 is trunked back through the switches, not tunneled to the ZD.  Guest Towers Switches: The VLANs of all guest tower switches are configured with VTP. The Center Tower 10th floor switch (10.65.5.4) is the VTP server, all other switch are clients to this server. VTP Version 2; VTP Domain: westin-guest; VTP Password: 509hki.   STP is set to pvst (per-vlan spanning tree) and enabled on all VLANs. The Center Tower 10th Floor switch is set as the root bridge. All wired connection ports are have PortFast enabled. This allows laptops and other such user devices to have an immediate connection, but if a switch is plugged into one of these ports, the port will disable.  DHCP Snooping is also enabled on all VLANs on all switches. Only the ports interconnecting switches are trusted ports, meaning they allow DHCP packets. This blocks all rogue DHCP servers that may get plugged into wired room connections. Additionally, DHCP rate limiting is set on all untrusted ports so that someone can't do a DoS attack on our DHCP server.  Guest Tower WAPs H500s WAPs are installed inside rooms now. We use 2 data pairs that we take from the single cat5 coming into the room. The other 2 pairs are used for 2 lines of the analog telephone in the room. ","The Fusions, core switch and ZD are in a 4-post half rack in the MDF/telephone room located on the basement level near engineering office. Room switches are located in electrical rooms on specific floors noted in network diagram.  APs for the Executive Office Suite 508 and Suite 513 connect to a switch located in the 5th floor Electrical Room Suite 510. There is 1 linksys Switch, 2 trend-net switch and a fiber transceiver. All of the devices are labeled for the Guest Wifi.  Guest room APs are in the ceiling of the hallways. See equipment list for specifics.  See WAP list for location of convention switches.

If WAPs go down and can't be recovered it is very possible that cable needs to be repaired. Some cabling was ""repaired"" using wirenuts for electrical cables.  If the hardwire connection not working for a guest - 90% chance it has to be fixed. Someone went through and spliced 3 ethernet cables inside the room together with electrical wirenuts.

He is now being texted NOC alerts for GW’s, Wireless Controllers and switches for his properties. You don’t need to email him regarding those alerts, but you should email him for information about the devices as far as possible ETR, cause, if known,etc. so we can inform CAS. 2.	If the Call Center is receiving a lot of calls from a property and the equipment appears to be up, please call him and give him all the information. 3.	If a ticket is escalated and we cannot resolve the issue, we need to inform him of these with all pertinent information via email and a heads-up call. So, we need to pay close attention to the tickets and jump on any from his properties. If we call a guest and get vmail, close the ticket unresolved and email Stephen.

Insignia which uses HDMI for the DIRECTV STB functions for the FTG STB are programmed into the slate remote. The “casting” and “TV” buttons are both programmed for the “input” scrolling menu for the TVs. HDMI is labeled “DIRECTV” and HDMI2 is Labeled “Chromecast” for the guestcast.  Scrolling to select the input is done by multiple presses of one button or the other. There is NO one press code for HDMI inputs on this consumer model TV 2.	Westinghouse: Which consists of 2 models: a.	One where the “source” button on the native remote only displays the input menu; then you need to navigate up or down and use the “OK” button” to select a new input. So these remotes required a macro for the two navigation buttons to function. See below for more detail on remote setup. b.	The other model the “Source” button brings up the input menus and scrolls in a downward fashion and loops through the input selections. The remotes for these TVs were programmed in front of the TV one at a time. See below for more details. Westinghouse remote programming- We had to use 4 of the blank [unlabeled] buttons on the remote to program “source” “Arrow up” “arrow down” and “OK” [select]. To build the Marcos on the remotes. The way the macros work if you use a key to build a macro you can’t change its assignment without effecting the macro. Also the EZ updater does not do a good job of duplicating the macros. So I have to correct Macros in front of every TV.  We have to have the arrow up and arrow down and OK buttons for FTG navigation. So I used the blank buttons on the remotes to copy the native remote as follows:  The button above the volume + [up} “Source” from the native remote The button below the volume – [down] “arrow up from the native remote The button below the Mute  “OK” button from the native remote The button below the CH – [channel down] button on the native remote With these buttons programmed – I was able to build macros for the Casting and TV buttons.   The remotes can be cloned with these buttons programmed for multiple remotes The 1, 2,3 to 9 and 0 [zero] must be programmed using the direct-TV remote [shipped on to Office with Masters] So the Westinghouse master has all of the buttons programmed for the TV Except the Casting and the TV which needs to be programmed using the 995 macro feature in front of the TV.

He is now being texted NOC alerts for GW’s, Wireless Controllers and switches for his properties. You don’t need to email him regarding those alerts, but you should email him for information about the devices as far as possible ETR, cause, if known,etc. so we can inform CAS. 2.	If the Call Center is receiving a lot of calls from a property and the equipment appears to be up, please call him and give him all the information. 3.	If a ticket is escalated and we cannot resolve the issue, we need to inform him of these with all pertinent information via email and a heads-up call. So, we need to pay close attention to the tickets and jump on any from his properties. If we call a guest and get vmail, close the ticket unresolved and email Stephen.

APs are patched to patch panels which are then connected to the switches. All switches in the MDF connect back to the Core Switch directly. There is an energy management system (Ving) in place which uses several of the switches, with each of the control units having its own wired connection.  Two switches are located in a separate closet on the 15th floor, just outside the service elevators. These also feed some of the APs and Ving controllers.  There are 126 APs that were previously installed, including ZoneFlex 7373, 7982, and 7055. APs are located in guest rooms on all guest floors (3-15), as well as the commons areas on the 1st floor and conference rooms on the 2nd floor.  The FUSIONS are set up for high availability, with daily backups being made of the primary FUSION configuration that is then sent to the backup FUSION. Failover is manual, however, and requires the most recent backup to be manually loaded from the backup FUSION's UI.

He is now being texted NOC alerts for GW’s, Wireless Controllers and switches for his properties. You don’t need to email him regarding those alerts, but you should email him for information about the devices as far as possible ETR, cause, if known,etc. so we can inform CAS. 2.	If the Call Center is receiving a lot of calls from a property and the equipment appears to be up, please call him and give him all the information. 3.	If a ticket is escalated and we cannot resolve the issue, we need to inform him of these with all pertinent information via email and a heads-up call. So, we need to pay close attention to the tickets and jump on any from his properties. If we call a guest and get vmail, close the ticket unresolved and email Stephen.

If the Call Center is receiving a lot of calls from a property and the equipment appears to be up, please call him and give him all the information. 3.	If a ticket is escalated and we cannot resolve the issue, we need to inform him of these with all pertinent information via email and a heads-up call.

We were hired to install the Fusion and assist with the installation. Due to several factors we ended up installing a ZD3000 and a cluster of 2 SZ100. In the future the SZ100 cluster will stay and the ZD3000 will be removed. Right now they have 3 virtual separated management networks (VLAN 1 - Old HP Wireless, VLAN 20 - Ruckus Smart Zone Wireless, & VLAN 21 - Ruckus Zone Director Wireless). The ZD was installed to work with the convention APs for the Conference tool, so only convention APs were provisioned with the ZD, the rest of will be associated with the Smart Zone Cluster. The MDF is located in the Mezzanine level by the offices. In the MDF we have the Hotwire WAN switch that feeds the Fusion, the core SW, Smart Zones and ZD is also there. The property has two towers with IDFs in different floors. Generally one IDF feeds the floor above and the floor below. In the guest rooms they are installing H500s and these APs will be feeding a hardwired connection, a minibar and the TV in the future. For the common and convention areas they are using R710s and for the outdoor they are using T300s. All the IDF are connected via multi-mode fiber and the Legendary Tower IDFs uplink from the MDF and the Ocean Tower IDFs  uplink from the Swamp IDF.","The MDF is in the mezzanine level and that is where the RS Fusions, Core switch 5406, Smart Zone 100 Cluster, and ZD are located. They have two towers and and the IDFs are as follow: Legendary Tower: - Swamp IDF in the Garage (5406 and 2510 switches) - SPA IDF (2915 - 8 port Switch) - Security Office IDF (5406 and 2610-48 switches) - 5th Floor IDF (5406 SW) - 8th Floor IDF (5406 SW) - 11th Floor IDF (5406 SW) - 14th Floor IDF (5406 SW) Ocean Tower - Parking Garage Valet IDF (2920-24 SW) - Ocean Tower Ballroom IDF (2920-48 SW) - 3rd Floor IDF (2920-48 SW) - 4th Floor IDF (5406 SW) - 7th Floor IDF (5406 SW) - 10th Floor IDF (5406 SW) - 14th Floor IDF (5406 SW) - 17th Floor IDF (5406 SW) - 20th Floor IDF (5406 SW) Cabanas IDF (2915-8 SW)","At this point they have 3 different guest networks: Old HP solution WiFi (management VLAN 1), Ruckus WiFi for the guestrooms and common areas with the a redundant Smart Zone 100 cluster (management VLAN 20), and Ruckus WiFi for the convention rooms with the Zone Director 3000.

These are connected to Zebra TW-522 Modems, but are powered with power adapters. The Ruckus AP's are mounted right next to the Zebra modems behind the beds, and the Zebra modems have their radios turned off. So that they don't conflict with one another. The LEDs on the Ruckus AP's have been turned off since the lights were disturbing the guests, and so guests were unplugging them. So you will need to check the link light on the port of the AP to see if it is connected or not.  *********emergency in case of Fusion Down******************(11-8-2021) IT is available from 8am to 5pm Monday though Friday.

His beyond TV box is set to expire in the year 2020.  Room 4 STB box was moved to room 21, due to that the original STB has a defective display port.  Will be shipping the box back to the office for replacement.  Room 7 has two TV, the living room and the Bedroom.  The STB box was placed in the Bedroom, the office would like to place a STB box in the living room but has not decided to used any of the boxes in room 1,or 3.  They have not decided if they will convert those rooms to real bedrooms or keep them as storage.  They will let us know.  Please note i left a SD card in Room 21 with the latest flash for the new Quam Box.  Update 2/16/17: I moved four of the STBs to the wifi connection.

No new equipment was installed other than a fusion. They were using a MSM 720 as BOTH a gateway and AP controller. The fusion was installed as the router and the MSM was kept to so that the HP model APs could be centrally managed. The MSM is NO LONGER being used as gateway.  The APs are a combination of older model HP APs and newer model HP dual band AP. They DO NOT have static IP addresses on them. They are dynamically assigned from the FUSION.  Switches are a combination of 3COM switches, Cisco switches and a unmanaged D-link switch located on the 9th floor. Switches are daisy-chained together using a cable which goes up the outside of the building.  Documentation was supplied to us by customer which is basically accurate.","MDF: lobby level back office on shelf behind door. Fusion is below monitor. Core switch is 1 shelf above it. PMS Comtrol box: one shelf below Fusion. Connected to seperate Admin network  Switches: Switches are located in ceilings of each floor either above access panels or above drop ceiling tiles.  APs: These are located in ceilings either behind access panels or above drop ceiling tiles. There is one in each hallway and in the center hallway by elevator above fire alarm light.    IMPORTANT NOTE 07/31/2015: The APs at Herald Square have a bug right now that causes them to stop working completely (which requires reset to factory defaults to fix) if they lose their uplink to the controller for any reason.  This means if a switch gets rebooted, controller gets rebooted, power goes down, cable gets unplugged for a few seconds, etc that the APs will go down and will not come back up until reset to factory.  To Reset APs: Hold down the reset button until all of the following has happened:  1. All indicator lights go out  2. All indicator lights go solid  3. All indicator lights blink 3 times Then release the reset button immediately. After you have done this the AP will show up as a suspicious device in the controller.  You then need to approve it and the AP should come back up a few minutes after you do that.  The APs on the lobby level MUST be reset in the following order: AP in center of eating area, AP outside rooms 19/20, AP outside rooms 9/10. If not reset IN ORDER, they will not join the controller. ","Staff usually calls asking the status of AP's. To check on this, log into the HP Controller and on the left hand side it shows AP's that have been detected, pending, or synchronized. If an AP is showing 'waiting for acceptance' or something other than synchronized, they will need to reset the AP's and then we have to Accept them so they can connect.",Fusion:  https://heraldsquare.hotelwifi.com/admin IP: 24.136.112.3/29 SN:  255.255.255.248 GW: 24.136.112.1 DNS 1: 8.8.8.8 DNS 2: 8.8.4.4  HP MSM720 AP Controller: https://24.136.112.3:60001,"Time Warner Cable Support: 866-636-5895 / 866-772-4948 Account number: 8150-2000-7113-1319  Phone # on acct: 212.279.4017 site address: 19 W 31st St New York, NY	  10001",20mbps/5mbps,,,,,"The PMS system is very slow and does not respond properly.

There are 2 things you need to know before you start working on the network: 1. Switches belong to the admin network (they did not want to buy new switches) 2. Management VLAN for Ruckus is TAGGED to the Ruckus WAPs (the admin network is running on VLAN 1 and they asked for wireless access to it. VLAN 1 does not touch the Fusion and we are not responsible for any portion of it, only for providing access to it from the switches)  Client wanted to save money, so that is a way we have to keep this network. We have went through switches that we are using and added vlan100 to them. That means that we DO have access to them. Please be careful about modifying the config on the switches as they are used for the admin purpose as well.    The system is a hybrid of Ruckus and VDSL2+ from Zebra. There are 3 buildings at this property: - 2400 Building - 2600 Building (Tower) - Pavilion  2400 and 2600 buildings are mainly Residential apartments. There we use VDSL2+ equipment.

Ask him what port and what switch it connects to 2. Configure the port as UNTAGGED (access vlan 100 or native vlan 100 for a trunk port)  3. Check the ZD make sure WAP come up, upgrades and goes down 4. Change the port to Trunk with Native VLAN 1 and Tagged allowed 1,100, 201 5.

There are 351 buildings with 900 units. Belair equipment was used to create two layers of wifi access.   The upper layer is created using BA100 nodes mounted on roof tops. These have a 5ghz backhaul and 2.4ghz client radios in them. A 2nd lower layer is created using BA100 with only 2.4ghz radios. These are meshed into the system using the 2.4ghz radios.  Their APs are Bellair Nodes which are large barrel like devices that are in the attics of designated house; they communicate to each other wirelessly. Because of their strength they are usually able to get the signal down to the residents houses, but because of their locations the residents’ computers are unable to communicate back to them.   In order to bring satisfactory internet service into residences, Ruckus MetroFlex routers have been deployed into certain units. The installed network does not provide a connection for what seems to be most of the houses in this small community. It has been this way since I started here.   Our solution for the people who call has been to provide Metroflexes (repeaters) for the residents who are unable to connect to the WiFi network.   A survey and reinstallation would be good, but I don’t know (nor have I spoken with any technician who does) of how to deploy a WiFi network for a site like this. It is a small community of houses. There is no legitimate useable infrastructure as there would normally be inside of a building.

There is a setting in the BIOS that can be changed so that f1 does not need to be pressed to boot, but as of today (12/30/21) that setting has not yet been changed. With this in mind if the Fusion is down then someone on location should connect a keyboard to the Fusion and press f1 to get it to boot if this problem is suspected.  For down AP's: send an email to Dan Gaus: sales@teledata-solutions.com and also include itdept@esitg.com in the CC's.

The procedure to do this is as follows: A spreadsheet should be created called accounts.csv I am attaching a sample to this ticket of what was used this year. A separate spreadsheet should be made that will be sent to the client. In this case I am calling it GV Account Info 2021 (attached to the ticket). The Unit and Bed Letter Column should remain the same, but the username and password column can be anything. To generate the password I used an excel formula of =RANDBETWEEN(10000,999999) in each cell. The usernames and passwords that are created here should be copied to the accounts.csv sheet in columns A - C  SSH into the Fusion as the admin user Become the root user with: ********Begin Fusion CLI Commands ****** iui su password: [enter the first string of the IUI as the password] su - **********End Fusion CLI Commands ******* I'll attach an image to the ticket showing the procedure Next: Drag and drop the accounts.csv file into the home directly (/space/admins/admin) Change directory to /space/rxg/console/tools (command is cd /space/rxg/console/tools) cat /space/admins/admin/accounts.csv | ./import_accounts  For some reason the Standard account group doesn't associated properly with the accounts using the import script. Each account should be assigned to the ""Standard"" account group after create. The easiest way to do this is to go to Identities > Accounts > Zoom the Accounts menu to 5000 and then do a batch update to replace the account group with Standard.  After the import is successful test a username and password on the portal to make sure that it works. if it does then send the ""GV account Info 2021"" (or whatever you called it) spreadsheet to the client so they can distribute it at the property.  ** See the ""Unknown"" Section of the documents for the examples  --Reference from note by Walter - 11 Aug 2021",,"See the ""Unknown"" section of the Docs for the list of per unit credentials.

If a ticket is escalated and we cannot resolve the issue, we need to inform him of these with all pertinent information via email and a heads-up call.

The gateway is a Cisco ASA (security appliance). It can be accessed on its public IP via ASDM or SSH, or a VPN tunnel can be established to it using Cisco AnyConnect to allow direct connection to local devices.  There are also 2 FUSIONs that have public IP addresses; these currently serve only as DHCP servers for APs, wireless clients, and other devices. They can also be used to access internal network devices via SSH. Identical DHCP pools are set up on each Fusion except for the Fan Wireless (VLAN 101) which has a pool on each Fusion that does not overlap the other. In the event of a Fusion failure, there is redundancy for the Fan Wireless, however for other networks the DHCP Failover Procedure must be followed (listed above in Troubleshooting Notes).  The Core Switch is actually a pair of Cisco 6504E chassis switches that are linked in a Virtual Switching System (VSS) - the two physical chassis serve as one logical node. There is a redundant 10Gbps connection between the two chassis.  All other switches are Cisco 3560s, either 24-port or 8-port, each with 2 x 10Gbps fiber connections to the Core Switch. These links are logically bundled into LACP port-channels, allowing redundancy and higher bandwidth. Switches can only be accessed via SSH to their private management IP, from the Fusion or over a VPN.  There are two Ruckus SCG200 AP controllers in a redundant configuration, each with multiple connections to the core. These are used to configure and monitor the access points.  Access points are Ruckus 7982, 7782-S, 7782-N, or 7372.",,"For assistance with down APs or other on-site troubleshooting, contact the following parties with Connectivity Wireless:  TO: Daniel Kurnath dkurnath@connectivitywireless.com (551-206-9857) CC: external_tickets@connectivitywireless.com FD 38966 -Tanya 3-24-2023  HIS, Marco is no longer with the company.

They may ask you for some information out of the SCG with regards to the authentication configuration.  Calls from this property will come to the NOC support team at all times during regular business hours, and will only be sent to Calltek during after-hours. Calltek has been advised to escalate all urgent calls from on-site staff immediately, following the standard after-hours escalation procedure. For non-urgent calls they will enter a ticket and escalate for Tier 2 resolution as soon as NOC team is next available.  If a new AP is added to the network, the following procedure must be followed:  1. Obtain the AP's MAC address from 5Bars, and find its IP address, using either the DHCP lease provided by the Fusion or the ARP table on the Core Switch. 2. Establish an SSH connection to the AP from the Fusion. Run the command ""set director ip 10.200.10.5"" (this is the control plane IP of the SCG - the management plane IP will not work). 3. Look in the SCG interface under Configuration > Access Points > Staging Zone for the new AP to appear. It can then be renamed and moved to the appropriate zone.   ############################################################################# NOC TEAM: YOU MUST CONTACT THE ENGINEERING SUPERVISOR OR  DIRECTOR OF NETWORK OPERATIONS IF THE PRIMARY FUSION (38.79.70.28) IS OFFLINE #############################################################################  To provide DHCP failover we will need to edit statements on the core switch, to modify the DHCP helper-address for all applicable VLANs to that of the backup Fusion.  DHCP Failover Procedure: 1. Establish either SSH session to Fusion or VPN tunnel to ASA 2. Establish SSH session to Core Switch at 10.200.9.1 3. Execute ""show run | begin interface Vlan"" and investigate the VLAN interface configuration.   Where configuration is as follows:    ""ip helper-address 10.200.9.50"" Modify the statement to read as follows:    ""ip helper-address 10.200.9.54""  4. Write changes to startup-config  This will point DHCP requests to the backup Fusion. It is not necessary to change the configuration for interface Vlan101 as this subnet has two non-overlapping DHCP pools, one set up on each of the Fusions.  In addition to the above you will need to tag VLAN 63 on port Gi0/1 on the ISP Uplink switch (10.200.9.45) and remove VLAN 63 from port Gi0/4 on the same switch. This is needed to allow the OpenTable network to continue working as it uses the Fusion as its gateway.    ############################################################################# To create a new network with internet access see document on docs tab titled ""How to create a new network with internet access Angels"".","Primary Fusion (used for DHCP only): https://angelsstadium.hotelwifi.com/admin  IP: 4.53.177.230 SN: 255.255.255.224 GW: 4.53.177.225 DNS1: 8.8.8.8 DNS2: 8.8.4.4  ===  Backup Fusion (used for DHCP only): https://angelsstadiumbackup.hotelwifi.com/admin  IP: 4.53.177.229 SN: 255.255.255.224 GW: 4.53.177.225 DNS1: 8.8.8.8 DNS2: 8.8.4.4  ===  vSmartZone1: https://4.53.177.227:8443  vSmartZone2:  https://4.53.177.228:8443  ===  Cisco ASA 5525-X: https://4.53.177.226/admin  Primary Uplink (Interface ""outside"") IP: 4.53.177.226 SN: 255.255.255.224 GW: 4.53.177.225  Backup Uplink (Interface ""altisp"") IP: 64.60.73.222 SN: 255.255.255.224 GW: 64.60.73.193  SCI https://sci.portals.neutralconnect.com/login  ===  4.53.177.231 is in use by the Angels Stadium IT department","Centurylink Tech support # 877 453 8353 Circuit id: 331767188  ===  There is a backup ISP that is only used for failover.

If you notice APs that are showing offline in the cloud controller but are pingable from the Fusion. Use the following commands   from the APs CLI to check if the AP is communicating / provisioned in the cloud.  1. Show about (Check if the AP has a Cloud Activation Key) 2. show ap debug cloud-server (Check the ""cloud config received"" option as well as the ""IAP mgmt mode"". The mgmt mode should be athena-mgmt not local-mgmt)  If this is confirmed as the error you will need to verify that this AP is communicating with the correct Virtual Controller (VC). The VC is an AP that is elected to the role. The VC address for the management zone is always the same. For example VC for mgmt2 is 10.102.0.2. For Mgmt3 it is 10.103.0.2. This address forwards traffic to the elected VC's actual IP address. The below command is one way to identify which VC the AP is actually communicating with.   Use the command -> show ap debug cloud-stats.   The output can be very verbose. Scroll to the very top and look for the line ""MIB_MASTER_IP_ADDRESS(131)=IP Address"" The IP address listed here should be the VC's IP address.

Protel is the company that is paying us, and we work together with them to keep the client happy. A different company (SuperClick) is receiving the first support calls from guests for this client. When a call comes in from this location it should be from a Superclick rep to our NOC phone number of 866 265 7575 ext 0 and by email to support@hotelwifi.com.  We have no ability to monitor the WAN at this property.  If both the Unifi controller, and Screenconnect PC cannot be accessed then the property should be called and asked to start the WiFi management computer in the Wormen House equipment room. Also note that the management computer and or UniFi controller being offline does NOT necessarily mean that there is an outage.  The network can work just fine without the controller.  Refer to the CRM docs tab for network documentation.  The property maps should be used in conjunction with ""PropertyDoc Master.docx"" to identify points of failure.  Most devices are in the Unifi controller, but not all of them.  The gateway for the network and several fiber switches are not in the controller. ****To troubleshoot LAN hosts, and to start the UniFi controller if it is not running use Screenconnect > HKI EXTERNAL group and connect to computer ""BCL0ADMIN-PC"".  The PC is generally already logged in, but incase it is not the Windows login is Protel / pr0t3l.  From here you can start the Unifi controller (an icon that says UniFi on the desktop) and run pings to any switch or AP.  You can also access the Protel managed Edgerouter at 172.16.0.1 protel / pr0t3l2929****  The NOC agent should attempt to resolve the issue remotely, if possible.  ***If issue is resolved remotely,  contact Guest asking them to check and make sure they are able to connect.

Michael Van Grieken is the principal contact for MVG. They can also be contacted via - mvgtech.las@belmond.com   ***IPTV Troubleshooting***  For issues with specific TVs:  - Ensure that VLAN configuration is correct on all switches between TV and encoders. VLAN 6 is the IPTV VLAN. If TV connects to MDU and then to switch, or directly to the switch, the appropriate switch port should be untagged for VLAN 6. If TV connects to AP, relevant port on AP must be untagged for VLAN 6, and relevant port on switch must be tagged.   - Ensure that IGMP is configured correctly on switches. Ensure that IP address for VLAN 6 is correct (192.168.100.0/20) and that ""ip igmp"" is enabled. For any ports which are tagged for VLAN 6, ensure that the ""ip igmp forward"" command is also entered, as well as ""no ip igmp querier"" command. These commands will ensure that IGMP traffic is handled correctly.  If channels do not display properly or do not have sound:   - Find out if the problem is with certain TVs or property-wide.  - Have onsite tech test a TV connected directly to the Dish Network receivers to see if it is an issue with Dish's signal or with our equipment. If it works correctly when directly connected to the receivers, troubleshoot the encoders.  - Log in to the encoder to see if there are any input errors. If there are it may still be an issue with the receiver or with the connection between the receiver and the encoder.  - There is a mechanical system in place that acts as a keepalive for the receivers. They will time out if there is no use of the channel after a certain period. After installation a system was put in place that is essentially a mechanical arm that clicks a remote in the TV room every 4 hours to ensure that the receivers stay online. Have local tech check this to make sure it is working.  - Try replacing HDMI cables to encoders, and reboot the receivers and encoders.  - Adjust video/audio settings to various values and have tech test to see if issue is resolved.  ==="," Fusion https://lasamannaresort.hotelwifi.com/admin  IP: 208.91.195.73 SN: 255.255.255.252 GW: 208.91.195.74 DNS 1: 8.8.8.8 DNS 2: 8.8.4.4  ===  Zone Director: https://208.91.195.73:60002  Thor IPTV Encoders: https://208.91.195.73:60041 (ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox) https://208.91.195.73:60042 (CNBC, CNN, MSNBC, ESPN) https://208.91.195.73:60043 (ESPN2, Fox News, Nickelodeon, Disney Channel) https://208.91.195.73:60044 (HBO, Showtime, Cinemax) https://208.91.195.73:60045 (Bloomberg, Russia Today, RAI Italia)  ===",Dauphin Telecom Support Number  +590 690 88 00 13  Luis Zapata luis.zapata@dauphintelecom.com,100 Mbps / 100 Mbps,,,,,,,,0,NULL,11/19/2021,BE86AE57-6A2A-4142-89C9-135A36C80086

He is now being texted NOC alerts for GW’s, Wireless Controllers and switches for his properties. You don’t need to email him regarding those alerts, but you should email him for information about the devices as far as possible ETR, cause, if known,etc. so we can inform CAS. 2.	If the Call Center is receiving a lot of calls from a property and the equipment appears to be up, please call him and give him all the information. 3.

Assign the STB a static lease      If you are swapping a STB in a room, make sure to replace that box 2. Ensure the box is running an Elliot Park firmware (use BTV Admin)     This is an automatic process and as long as the box is connected to the correct network, it will eventually upgrade.

IR Blasters - The IR Blasters seem to be more sensitive to wifi signal strength than the STB. The IR Blaster tends to stop communicating when Wifi signal is low and doesn't always reconnect by itself. The handling, if for example the IRB is not changing to the TV Channel from the Guide, is to manually unplug and re-plug the IRB (where the USB cord connects to the IRB) at the back of the TV, then test with the remote to see if the IRB is working. If that doesn't work, try restarting the STB IU or reboot the STB. I also noticed in a few rooms where the signal strength was good that the IRB would stop communicating despite the good signal strength. The same procedure should work to get the IRB back working.  Chrome Device - Sometimes the Chromecast device stops working due to low wifi signal strength. Unplugging and re-plugging the Chrome's USB connection from the TV will reboot the device and usually causes the Chrome device to reconnect.  Live TV and its connection - They have a coax cable that comes directly out of the wall to the TV set. It does not go into the STB, so any TV issue will be with the hotel TV provider. The only thing plugged to the STB is the HDMI cable, the IRB and the remote dongle.",Fusion: https://dylansfo.hotelwifi.com/admin/ IP: 216.75.224.179 SN: 255.255.255.248 GW: 216.75.224.177 DNS1: 8.8.8.8 DNS2: 8.8.4.4  Esxi:  https://dylansfoesxi.hotelwifi.com IP: 216.75.224.180  IPMI: https://dylansfoipmi.hotelwifi.com IP: 216.75.224.181 ,ISP - WiLine Networks Inc. 1-888-4WILINE 1-888-4945463 Tanya 22/2/23,,,,,,,,,0,05-12-2020,6/24/2024,BE86AE57-6A2A-4142-89C9-135A36C80086
