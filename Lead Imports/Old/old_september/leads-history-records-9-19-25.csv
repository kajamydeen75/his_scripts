Ferreld,  It was nice talking to you about your property.  I am going to loop in Dave DeBroux who is our partner with Beyond TV.  They offer the Guest cast solution that we discussed and can work with any of the hospitality TV’s  Just a reminder on how the solution works is you will have a Head end unit and a devise at each TV that is connected over wifi and into the HDMI port of the TV.  The Guest will hit the casting button the remote control and it changes the input to the TV.  The guest will then scan a QR code on the TV, enter their room number and the check out date.  Once they complete that step they are connected to the system and can cast directly from their devise.  Since they log into their devise, there information is never in danger but just to be safe, all information is wiped at check out date.    Also, since the devise connects over wifi, it also will serve as a beacon to record signal strength so you will know the points of your property that have a strong signal and which areas of the property may need to be upgraded to improve the performance.  Dave,   GrFerreld has a 130 room property and is exploring casting for their guests.

Opportunity: This is an opportunity for Beyond TV.  Conversation Description:  eCoast Business Development Representative Margaret Becirevic contacted Four Points by Sheraton Houston and spoke with Delana Davenport the GM. Margaret introduced herself as calling on behalf of Hotel Internet Services and inquired if the hotel is planning to evaluate the wireless infrastructure in the coming year. According to Delana they recently made upgrades and she felt they would be in good shape for some time to come. Margaret introduced Beyond TV and inquired if the hotel was using such a service but Delana said not. They had a video on demand service but they had more problems with it than benefits so they ended up removing it. She said if they were able to find a benefit to their customers they would consider implementing a solution like Beyond TV. She agreed to a follow-up call within the next few days to discuss the benefits of Beyond TV in greater detail.   Pain Statement/Business Driver: The hotel does not have video on demand or a solution like Beyond TV in place. Delana said they had problems with the last solution provider and they ended up removing the service from the hotel. She would like to see if adding Beyond TV would benefit the hotel and provide a better guest experience.   Budget Process and Status: Funding will be made available providing a positive ROI is found.   Time Frames for Purchase & Implementation: Purchase and Implementation will take place within 12 months.  Decision Making Process & Players: Delana Davenport GM will make recommendations to the owners for final approvals.   Partners and Brands Used: Currently they do not have a solution like Beyond TV or video on demand in place.  Action Item/Next Step: An email has been sent to Delana thanking her for her time on the phone and linking her to the Hotel Internet Services website. She is expecting a follow-up call within the next few days to discuss the benefits of Beyond TV in greater detail.
