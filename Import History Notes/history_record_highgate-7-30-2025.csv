The Chf Engineer said there is a project to replace carpet, furniture and paint in every room in the hotel. He said the Painters had approached a few months ago asking if they could take the APs off the walls and he said ""NO"". He said its suspicious that APs going down is date coincident with painters and carpet layers starting work on, specifically, the 8th floor.
    Of note also is that the stairs from the Lobby to the lower ballroom was eliminated when the lobby was recently renovated and the lower ballroom and meeting rooms are no longer being used and are just being used for storage (there are still APs on the lower lobby floor).",AP Maintenance,,2017-12-20 17:37:35.773,, ,,Contact not found.

I tested it directly on the IDF switch an could not get it to come up. I tested the cable to the room and it was fine. It appears that the AP had some sort of power issue as it looks like it cause port 8 on the IDF switch to shut down its PoE power. I replaced the AP with a new one.

Regarding that Jakes Café AP being down again.  This seems to be a recurring issue and the AP has been replaced.  It seems there may be an issue with the cabling and we might need a new cable run.

Please See Walter’s previous emails below.

Michael – can we have Fred dispatched to the property please?

Fred, the details are:
Goes to port 25 on the 10.60.30.12 switch port 25, SN CN48FP322F in the Sub Cellar Level MDF.  Model of AP that is offline right now is r710, MAC e8:1d:a8:35:11:50, SN 411703006462.  AP should be located near the Jakes café.

Subject: RE: The Knickerbocker NYC Jake's WiFi
If I’m not mistaken, each time this has been worked on its been found that a cabling problem is what is causing it to be offline.
Also, recently this AP was replaced with a new one, and the periodic up and down happened before the AP was replaced as well, so it is not likely an AP issue.  If there is still a problem with it then it is very likely the cable run.

Hello,
The Knickerbocker NYC Jake's WiFi seems to go off line every few months and to resolve it the connection to the switch/port needs to be reset and than it come back up. Can it be that the AP is not working properly and it shall be replaced ?

However, we do regularly receive negative comments about our lack of coverage at Swell Pool & Bar. Additionally, as we begin to elevate our event spaces, the expectation will similarly increase and we’d like to be sure that we can deliver the service for our groups. 
Thank you again for reaching out. We look forward to your assistance in getting the entire property up to speed.

As we talked on the phone, I sending email about the changes what we made to get your ""Staff"" devices up, online.

The staff devices iPhones and iPads are connected to HIS Wi-Fi SSID and that's hasn't been changed.

These devices use to connected and have internet through a PBX telephone system, which we don't have any control on, and we don't really know about it. Last night it went down some reason and that's why you didn't get internet access. When you tried to connect to the HIS Wi-Fi it was connected, but you got an error message says: ""Internet may not available""

For resolve this issue, in the Fusion gateway we created a new network. Took over the ""Staff"" devices and providing internet through the Fusion Gateway, not from the PBX telephone system.

I asked you to check the Staff devices including the housekeeping devices and you said everything is working fine and those devices are online. At this point we can keep all changes as it is, no further action needed.

If you will receive issues some devices what you couldn't check before, please let us know and we will help you to make them online also.

Thank you very much, have a great day!

Maybe we can check on the Century Link devices if those are powered up or not, so we can determine what kind of outage is this.

Hi Amy, how are you?

The Centurylink is 1G/1G actually the real measure 865/701 Mbps but yes that is considering 1G.

About the WAN2 Megapath, is coming up as Comcast, and that is 35/20. Is Megapath related with Comcast there?

Please confirm you have bandwidth at 1 Gig at the Taj Boston. Your implementation occurred right after the upgrade and the new circuit was only 300M.

Primary should be 1 GIG (Centurylink)
Backup should be 100/20 cable modem ( Megapath)

Thank you!
Amy

I called today and left a message for you. Sorry I missed you! We handle the WIFI system & support services for the hotel and I just wanted to check in and see how things are going with your support services. Is everything working to your satisfaction?

Any feedback would be great or if you can let us know if there is something I can help with.

Just for an interesting read, we recently did a full survey of guests and hoteliers that is chalk full of good bits of information. Here is the link for that - https://www.hotelwifi.com/gre-survey-wp/

Looking forward to hearing back from you.

I noticed we show the AP for room 1510 to be down and disconnected in the zone director, yet when I search the switch port it should be connected to there is now a different AP for room 1506 in its place. Can you verify for me whether or not there is still an AP for room 1510 being used or if the one in 1506 replaced it? I suspect so as the uptime for the AP in 1506 coincides with the downtime of the AP from 1510.

The mac address for the AP that we have listed as being in 1510 is 6C:AA:B3:30:BA:90.

Hello Ethan,

I see that all the equipment is up and users are successfully connecting to the WiFi at WestHouse.

Is there a location or room number where the problems are manifesting themselves?

Is it an issue with last name and room number?

There is an event this evening that is using a port on that POE switch that is not a WAP. I did plug a patch cable into the POE switch either 1-9 - do you see that? I must ensure this is not disrupted.

Even though I know you would not alter that config you just changed the config that the WAP was plugged into

Hi Brandon,

I've located the issue that was causing this problem.  It would appear that someone had moved a few cables around on the MDF PoE switch (IPECS is the manufacturer of the switch, model # ES-3026P, IP address 10.60.30.9).  There was an AP that was plugged into a port that was not configured for use on the guest network.  Since this AP was working correctly yesterday the only logical conclusion is that the port that this AP was plugged into has been changed.  Because of this all users connecting to this AP were not able to get to the Fusion and not able to get online.
I added the needed configuration for the port that this AP was moved to and users are now able to get online.  Users that were running into this problem were primarily connecting through the AP that I have already fixed but I still see a few more 169 addresses on the network so I'll need to run through the config on a few more switches to see if cables have been moved around anywhere else on the network.
At least twice in the past this has occurred and I've needed to correct it, and also as recently as last week a DHCP server was plugged into the ZoneDirector at the property which also caused an issue for a lot of guests.
If at all possible please track down why this is occurring so that we can avoid this happening in the future to avoid these issues for the guests and to avoid the hours of work that it adds for us.

Thanks,

(I am copying all of the contacts we have at the property because I want to make sure everyone is reached. Please update us on any contact changes and excuse our errors.)

UNTIL MARCH 26th, 2022, you can renew all back Ruckus Annual Support for the cost of ONE YEAR of support.
They are re-starting support.
That means, if you are expired 3 years, and you order tomorrow, your support will be good for one year from the date of purchase.
You don’t have to buy back support.
There is no reinstatement fee.

Also, as of APRIL 1ST,2022, the price of Ruckus Annual Support will be increasing 5-10%. If you sign off now, you can lock in the old rate.

This is what the Ruckus Annual Support covers:

1.            Advanced Hardware Replacement In the event of hardware failure, Premium Watchdog Support customers may receive a replacement Zone Director in advance of return shipment. All returns must be authorized and assigned RMA numbers in advance by a Hotel Internet Services Support member.
2.            Software Updates and Upgrades Bug fix and maintenance releases and accompanying documentation are available via Hotel Internet Services or the Ruckus Support Web site. Premium Watchdog Support customers will be provided with software upgrades for the applicable term of their software contract.
3.            Extended Warranty on Outdoor Access Points With the purchase of Premium Watchdog support or Advanced Hardware Replacement, all outdoor access points connected to your Zone Director will have its warranty extended to the life of the Zone Director instead of the usual 1-year warranty that came with the purchase of the outdoor access point

1/3/5 years are available on most equipment.

Ask us to send you an updated quote.

Charles I believe that the switch port that the Fusion connects to is in the wrong VLAN on the admin network.  When I do a tcpdump on igb3 I am seeing traffic in the 10.2.98.0/24 network and not the 10.2.99.0/24 network that we are suppose to be in for communicating to the PMS server.  I believe Highgate uses the third octet to identify the VLAN on their switches, so the switch port that the Fusion connects to on their switch is in VLAN 98 currently, and it should be in VLAN 99.  The MAC address of the Fusion on igb3 is 0c:c4:7a:c5:62:67.  Centrada should be able to see this MAC address on their side when they search in their switches.
Get them to change the port we are connected to so that it is native in VLAN 99 and that should resolve the problem.  Centrada should be able to assist with this.",Ticket Notes,,2018-09-24 16:30:18.593,, ,46C855CC-2322-4FB9-A716-81459320234B,Contact not found.

Changed inactivity timeout on ZD from 5 minutes to 500 minutes. Also I have noticed Timekeeper AP has 99 devices associated to it and all the devices are connected to HotSOS1 SSID. Increased the limit of AP to allow clients on each radio to 150 and also changed the AP group system default to allow 150 clients. But the Timekeeper AP keep on refusing the client to join differnet SSID. Opened a ticket with Ruckus on this. They wanted me to create a ssid and broadcast on the AP without tunneling it.

She said that I could close this escalation. I acknowledged her and told her I would do so, but that she could contact us if she needed any help with this going forward.  Then I wrote up a Red-tag and sent it in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    3/3/22 Sent a note to Red tag team for an update on this Highgate escalation.                                                                                                                                                      2/2/22 Jasmin Santos,  Office Coordinator for IGC Hospitality.  She says they are having issues with connectivity on the rooftop (bar & restaurant, where the employees hang out). She asked if we could move AP's, perhaps higher, to correct the problem, and if there would be charges.  Also asked it we could send someone out to check all the APs and make sure everything is running smoothly.

Sorry to bother you this afternoon – clearly you were busy!

Hello Support,

The Time Warner backup cable modem for these hotels has gone offline.

Cable Modem - 50.74.93.105 is offline
Park Central Fusion backup circuit – 50.74.93.108 is offline
WestHouse Fusion backup circuit – 50.74.93.109 is offlilne.

I don’t have account number information for this service or I would have contacted Time Warner Directly.

Please help escalate this to the appropriate person who might be able to reboot the modem and/or contact Time Warner to explore the outage.

If account number information can be shared, I’d be grateful.

All, 

I just spoke to Spectrum. They are saying it is signaling issues and the plant maintence team is still working on the ticket. It is not he modem, but issues at the street. That ticket is still opened. 

They are resetting the modem and sending another ticket to the plant maintence team. 

I am opening a billing ticket to get a credit for the 7 days we have not had service. 

Two ticket numbers: 123506 (from end of last week) and (03854815 from today).

They said the ticket has a tech assigned so they assume the outside work should be completed today.

We replaced the data cable for room 2302 WAP Yesterday.  The new cable was not able to be punched to the original patch panel port, which is labeled ""23E"". I terminated the cable, marked ""2302"", with male RJ45 plug and plugged it directly into port 7 of the switch, labeled 22-2. The WAP in room 2302 lit up with the new cable.
FYI, The original bad cable was over heated on top of a hallway light and the wire jackets were carbonized and caused the shortage.

I’m trying to gather the latest IP info for Royalton Park Avenue.  It appears my notes are out of date (wrong).

The Backup WAN connection on the Fusion went down a few minutes ago.  98.0.133.58 with a gateway of 98.0.133.57.  It has since come up again.

I called Towerstream but they said they didn’t own/control that IP address.  They did tell me that they showed the Primary WAN connection on the Fusion 69.38.171.2 was up with its gateway of 68.38.171.1.

I thought I’d take the opportunity to request the correct circuit information along with Support phone numbers, account numbers, Link IDs, etc, for both circuits please.

There is a Cisco switch with two Gig ports. The right hand ports is the ISP Feed which goes on Cat5e cable to the IDF on the 34th Floor. On the 34th floor the ISP Feed plugs into port 19 on blade F. The reason the ISP Feed was down was that the 34th IDF Switch was down due to being plugged into a failed UPS. I moved the 34th IDF Switch off the dead UPS an onto a separate power stripe.

As we talked on the phone, I see only 3 APs down from the 115. Down APs in room 411, 1416 ( noted missing) and 1603.

I was able to log in to the portal page with one of the room's credential, but the PMS has an error - Can't connect to the sever.
I restarted the PMS on our side, but no change. It needs to be restarted from the admin side also, to have the connection back.

Please let us know if the issue is still exist.

Thank you.

The Fusion’s WAN1 interface and its gateway were dropping several packets. I called the property. An engineer is waiting for an AT&T router to be sent to the property to bring WAN2 back up. I asked if he could reboot the WAN1 modem. It was rebooted.   	
A staff member called the NOC. He said that WAN2 was back up. The Fusion’s WAN2 IP address and its gateways were still not responding to pings. I asked the staff member to see if he could verify if the new AT&T router was using the same IP address it was before. He said that he would get more information and call us back. 
Someone from Centrada called. He conferenced in a few people to get the Wi-Fi back up at the property. Someone from AT&T informed us that port 2 on the AT&T router was supposed to be used to connect to the Fusion. This port was not connected to anything. The Fusion ‘s WAN2 interface was connected to port 7 on the core switch. The core switch did not seem to have empty ports. When the AT&T router was connected to port 3 on the core switch, the Fusion’s gateway came up but the Fusion was still down. They could not find out which port the old ISP device was connected to. I suggested that they connect the Fusion directly into the AT&T router. They did this and the Fusion came up.

Subject: Royalton Park Avenue SW-IDF-6-1 is down

Hi Jared, how are You?

We've noticed the SW-IDF-6-1 switch is down at the property of

Royalton Park Avenue
420 Park Avenue
New York , NY   10016
212-317-2900.

I called the property and I was able get a hold of Nelson. He went to check on the switch to the 6th floor IDF. I tried to call him, but the phone directly going to voicemail. I left a voicemail with my desk number to call me back.

The switch is still down, I believe it is power issue. If the switch is on, we might need to power cycle it. Here is the switch details below, please check it out.

172.16.0.13

They are replacing some of these so these need to be added to use the wifi.
I found that the ACL has the maximum number of MAC addresses that can be added already, so for now I've requested the MACs of the previous units so I can remove those and add the new ones.
This may not be info that the property has so I'll likey be changing the setup slightly here so a MAC group in the Fusion is used instead of the current L2 ACL.That way we can simply setup a MAC pattern for Panic Button devices and will not need to add anymore in the future.",Information,,2015-06-22 17:04:39.760,, ,,Contact not found.

It appears the backup internet feed is currently offline.
I've contacted your internet service provider and I was told there is a service interruption in the area

The center ceiling of the meeting room was severely flooded by a water pipe break. AP-FL03-Franciscan was right in the middle of the leak. Engineer Alan Purdue said that the AP was found sitting in a pool of water. One of the Engineers removed it and its somewhere on the floor covered by carpet that they have been pulling up. As soon as he can locate the AP I will try powering it up.

Hello Debbie,
 
I tried to reach Jasmin a couple of time to no avail.
 
After that I got sidetracked by new incoming tickets.

Benjamin,
 
Jasmin admitted she was a little confused herself as to where the problem lies.
It’s probably best you call her directly to ask her for more specific information.

Can anyone be more specific as to what networks they are connecting to?
What does shaky mean? Users get bumped off or lose connection?
Cannot connect one minute to the next?

Debbie,
 
Seeing as this is a complaint more so about connectivity of the current system, this should be sent to the support team for which I have copied.  The NOC can review the network, see if anything can be fixed or if it is best to make changes to the network.  At that time, Stephen would then be involved.

Subject: ISSUE: The Rooftop, Royalton Park Avenue
Importance: High
 
Dear All,,
 
I just got a call from Jasmin Santos, the Office Coordinator for IGC Hospitality
at the Royalton Park Avenue.  She said the wifi is “shaky up there” on the rooftop
(bar and restaurant area) and wants to know if we can send someone out there to
review all the access points and make sure everything is working properly.  She asked
if there would be a cost for that.  She mentioned that they wonder if moving APs up higher
would help, and what the cost would be for that.  She also mentioned that this is where the
employees hang out on their breaks, etc.
 
I told her I would get someone in touch with her to address her concerns and answer
her questions.  Stephen, could you please reach out to her?
 
Her contact info is:      646-591-4211
                                    jsantos@igchospitality.com
 
Thank you.

Stephen, so what did the GM and MSL say when you spoke?  Do they intend to invest?   If not, how about getting them to pay one of our engineers to go there and troubleshoot the current system.  They say it was working well a year ago and now it is progressively getting worse.   We need to try and provide a solution here.

The existing network was installed before HIS took over this property in 2015, I just spoke with MSL & the GM about the need to replace their network with newer hardware two weeks ago, this has been an ongoing issue for several years, the owners refuse to spend the money to resolve the problem.

Importance: High
 
Dear All –
 
I received an email from Andy Davidson today, in response to my conversation
with him yesterday.  He included the email chain related to the issues they are having
and asked that we read through it, and see what we can do.  It appears there has been
back and forth traffic since mid January. He asks that we work with his IT company, and
call him with any questions.  Please see his concerns below:
 
Thank you for your email Debbie,
Yesterday when I told you everything was okay, I was specifically referring to the hiccup that happened yesterday with ISP.
Everything seemed to recover, thank goodness, back to the status quo.
You should know that I have been complaining to our 3rd party IT company and to HIS that our Wifi is not performing the way it should and has become “status quo”.
This has been going on for months.
Please read through the email chain attached.
You guys give me a list of AP’s that are down (on your end), I investigate, send you my findings, and seemingly nothing happens.
3rd party IT company Edge, said last, that our Wifi system is old and just needs to be replaced.
Guests seem to be increasingly complaining about “Internet”, and I believe there are little things we can do to make it better.
For example, if AP’s are room specific, why don’t we fix the AP’s that are in the wrong room.
Other examples, no light on AP, no AP at all, etc.
Please see what you can do, working with our IT company.
Call me if you have any questions.
Thank you,
Andy
 
I have emailed back a response acknowledging him and told him we will address this and be in touch with him.
Can someone please help get this resolved?
 
Thank you,

Hello Heide,
 
I’m looping in my support team to assist with troubleshooting the current issues.   Let me give you a bit of background of the wireless network & HIS.  We took over this property in June of 2016 with a Fusion Gateway & network support, at the time the hotel requested to keep the Aruba wireless network which was installed in 2014 by another vendor. Initially the network was fine, however in the last couple of years there have been some issues with the guest Wi-Fi as the network equipment is EOL and the technology is now outdated.  Last August we submitted a proposal to upgrade the network with new Ruckus in room APs ( see the attached)   The current network is over 8 years old.  We can continue to tweak and try and fix the issues that keep occurring, however the best solution at this time would be upgrading the network to the most current hardware available in the market space.  Let me know if you want us to revise the attached quote with updated information.

PLS NOTE: This email originated from outside of HIS.

Hello, Stephen:
 
I hope that all is well.  I am writing to you in hopes that you will help me with some special attention in Key West at the Marker.  Below you will see a recap from Andy Davidson (copied here) on continuous issues with wi-fi.
 
I would like to have a proper point of contact since going through support, although fine when issues come up, doesn't work when they are repetitive and/or prolonged.  We really need to dig deep to see where we can assist the property.  
 
My initial thoughts would be:
 
1.  Is there a recent wi-fi heat map of the property?  Both passive and active?
Do you have a set of -asbuilts?
How often do you do maintenance on your equipment with firmware updates?
 
I know that you will most likely refer us to someone else...just wanted you to be aware that this is going on.
 
I look forward to your anticipated quick response.
 
All the best...
 
Heide

Heide,
I can recap.
·         The guests who stay at our hotel are complaining more and more about “Internet”.

·         This guest Internet dissatisfaction has been noticeably higher over the last 2 months approximately.

·         The WiFi provider, HIS, has recently (in the last 2 months) given me a list of all access points (AP’s) that show problems on their end (about 8% of the AP’s).

·         We have not been able to mine for details as to what “Internet” problems guest are having – this is not an easy task.

·         We have not been able to correlate problematic AP’s with complaining guests – this is possible only sometimes as guest reviews don’t always have room number, nor do we know where on property they had the problem.

·         So far, I don’t see any correlations or patterns to complaints, such as all coming from one section, etc.

·         I have assessed 7 of the 8 problematic AP’s

·         I find issues with the 7 problematic AP’s, like: missing AP altogether, AP’s not numbered for the room, no green light.

·         I find good download speeds (ds) and good upload speeds (us) using SPEEDTEST in those same 7 rooms.

·         During this same time period, we have had Internet connectivity issues with laptops and phones that did not seem to happen before roughly 2 months ago.

·         I personally have noticed the WiFi trying to bounce between our 2 networks.  HIS told me to just forget one of them, which I did, and that mostly worked – it didn’t used to happen before.

My specific AP assessment details are below.
I’ve been DOE here for almost 3 years and really was our only “IT” person for over a year while we had no local rep like Van.
Yes, I worked with Centrada, but many times they weren’t able to respond quickly enough.
While I’m not an IT person, I have historical IT experience at this hotel, Southernmost and other businesses.
For example, I signed Broadwave on about two years ago as provider for Internet and some phone lines – we used Comcast before.
Under Broadwave as the ISP, we haven’t had WiFi complaints in the last year as much as recently.
 
Please let me know if you have any further questions.
I’m available almost anytime Tuesday thru Saturday, 8a-4:30p, unless we have breakdowns.
Tuesdays are usually not the best.
Tomorrow is fine after 9:30a EDT.
Thank you,

Hello, Andy:
 
I think we should set up a call to discuss this.  Is there a way you can recap the issues in an email and send me info to date and we can talk internally first and then bring in the wifi provider?
 
H
 
I know this is important; it just doesn't belong in support when it's bigger issue than a sporadic AP here and there.  Hope you understand.
 
We need to hold your wifi provider accountable and I have some good ideas there.
 
Want to meet tomorrow?
 
Send me some good times and I'll set up a call.

Good Afternoon Heide,
I was just able to check room 145 Wifi.
It has an AP, numbered BD147 – it has a green light.
ds=48.1 / us=47.6.
Again, good speeds, but room number and AP do not agree.
Looking forward to hearing back from you.
Thank you,

Good Afternoon Heide,
I know we closed the ticket out for WiFi issues, but I believe we still have unsolved problems.
We are starting to see a growing number of guests complaining about “Internet”.
Granted, we do not have much detail to chase down root causes, however, HIS has supplied me with a list of problematic AP’s.
This is what they can see on their end, and you can see below the results of my investigation on hotel site.
We should at least fix what we know to be a problem.
I sent the below information in last week.
It was suggested I send it directly to you.
Please let me know what the next step would be.
Thank you,
Andy

Good Morning,
I was able to check 2 more rooms wireless Internet this morning:
·         145 – unavailable today

·         146 – No AP, ds=48.9/us=47.7

·         202 – Number 202, green light, ds=42.8/us=35.8

·         234 – unavailable today

Good speeds persist, but missing AP can’t be helping us.
Thank you,

Good Afternoon,
I’m following up your weekly meeting with an update to ticket number 750536.
HIS recently supplied me with a list of guest rooms where they can see issues on their end.
They asked me to check the access points (APs).
I was just able to check 4 of 8 today, and here’s what I found:
·         122 – Number BD122, green light, ds=47.8/us=44.9

·         130 – No number, green light, ds=41.7/us=47.6

·         135 – Number BD134 (so, wrong number), green light, ds=47.9/us=47.1

·         141 – Number BD141 (again, wrong number), no light, ds=46.5/us=47.7

·         145 – unavailable today

·         146 – unavailable today

·         202 – unavailable today

·         234 – unavailable today

I’m seeing (what I consider) good speeds in the 4 rooms I checked.
However, the AP’s are either the wrong number or no number and one with no green light (no light at all).
I have heard that these APs are programmed to be in certain rooms.
If so, maybe we need to do some re-programming.
We do not always have information on guest complaints telling us exactly what the issue was.
Sometimes they just grade the “Internet” low.
I don’t have information on which rooms were complaining and if they coincide with the list I was given by HIS.
Thank you,

We recently received an outage alert at the following properties:

Park Central Hotel New York

The gateway is offline for both of these properties.

After contacting your internet service provider it appears there's a service interruption because of due payments.
I was not able to get any more information because this is a national account.

This is a backup link for these properties and shouldn't affect users. However if the primary links go offline, it will disturb all users at each property.

As we discussed today we have limited access to the network right now in order to monitor the devices and let you know when the equipment has gone offline. This is because of some changes that were made by another party to the IP addresses, credentials and or VLANs that has limited our ability to monitor and access the network.
One of the services that you pay us for is to alert you when equipment has gone offline, and our ability to do that right now is limited. If you would like for us to fully deliver this service to you we can send out one of our technicians to redocument the network and get us access to everything, but there would be a charge for this. Another alternative is you could restore our access to the 172.16.0.x subnet on the switches throughout the property. My guess is that there is a VLAN tag missing somewhere for VLAN 101 on one of the switches that we don't have access to.  For your reference I have attached our ""as built"" documentation when the network was initially installed.  Here are the devices that we are currently able to monitor for your reference:

The port on the switch was verified as working. 1416 has a cable issue between the patch panel and the room. He tried using just 2 pairs on pins 1,2,3 & 6 as well and it still did not come up. He did not have a cable tester with him so was unable to determine the good pairs. the AP that was in 1206 is missing so we replaced it with the one from 1416 since the cable for 1416 was bad and we cldn't get it up at this time.

things are going with the WIFI and support at the property.

Is everything working to your satisfaction?  Is there anything you need

I wasn’t on this email chain, so I’m not sure if you’ve been given a full answer to your email yet. Cary was able to urgently arrange a Galaxy tech for this morning, and I am working with him right now to get our integration completed with them this morning and activate billing on the guest network. 

Below is the data I have on how this all transpired. As I’ve not been involved in all conversations, I can only give you the broad strokes:

-          Service with Sunray was cancelled on the 21st, which unfortunately included Sunray turning off authentication and billing.
-          I found out about this on the 26th, and after conversations between Cary, Thomas and I, Cary scheduled Galaxy immediately and I believe Galaxy got involved on the 27th.
-          The data was not available on the 27th as to where we were supposed to connect into the admin network to communicate with Galaxy so the integration was not able to be completed at that time.
-          We received the port information on the 28th, and Thomas assisted on the evening of the 28th to make some changes on the admin switch to allow communication from our server to Galaxy.
-          As mentioned above, I’m working with Galaxy to get this completed this morning. Aside from the integration, we have everything ready – the portal page is fully built, the billing plans are loaded in our system, and we moved all of the WiFi, including the remnants of the old system, off the Nomadix to our gateway. So as soon as the integration is complete, we can go live with billing.

Best,

To whome it may conern,

The name of the device is Park Central Hotel San Francisco SW-IDF-22-01.

Hi,
I tested the Ethernet in the Park Avenue Ballroom Pre-Function area and the network came up, but I was unable to access the internet. Can you help me trouble shoot?
We have a group coming in next week that wants to use the hard line.
Perhaps it's a setting issue.
I am out this weekend but back on Monday.

Thanks!
Diane

I configured port 28 on Switch 10.20.28.11 with VLAN 900 (Broadwave Vlan) and tagged the switch up link interfaces with the same VLAN in order to get the Camera working.

Camera was using IP address 162.251.177.172 and after the configuration I was able to get into the GUI interface.

No port forwards were set to access the Camera's GUI interface.

The printers should be connecting to the switch on the 3rd Floor switch IP: 10.60.30.14. Several of the ports are already untagged with vlan 321. We need to work with Jenny on insure the correct ports are assigned Vlan 321. I also noticed that the AP for the Salon was currently down, and requested to have someone investigate and either plug the AP back in or find out if the AP was replaced. The guests will be using between 80 and 125 Mbps bandwidth. I configured it for 150 to help insure the speeds are close to what they needed. I also informed Jenny that we will need the MAC address of the device they want to use a VPN with so we could assign a NAT to it, and that their IT need to allow for a NAT to work over their VPN.

After wehn the 20 minutes boot up completed, we needed to reboot the APs by itself in the switch. 4 APs remained offline, but there was no linking port on the switch. Probably cable issue.

We lost our connection to the PMS server at this location earlier today which caused problems for guests trying to login to the wifi.  This problem was caused by a device that was added to the network by some other party, which was using the same IP address as our Fusion Gateway.  To resolve this we changed the IP address that our Fusion Gateway was using.  Once we did this our link to the PMS server was restored, and we once again started to receive guest reservation information.  Guests should now be able to successfully login and get online.
Michael, here are some details about the problem so that this situation can hopefully be avoided in the future.  If you would like me to change our IP back to what it was originally once the device added today has been identified then let me know and I will do that.
IP address that we were using to communicate to the Opera PMS server - 10.0.9.35
IP address that we are now using to communicate to the PMS server - 10.0.9.36
IP:port  of Opera server - 10.0.10.7:5018
MAC address of the host that was added to the network today that caused an IP conflict, and is now using the IP address that we used to be using - 00:17:61:11:fa:8d

See the below response to my offering- Gary can we shut this down in a manner that it wont function whatsoever?   I believe if we do they may start receiving complaints from guests which may motivate them to restart services

Ranjan,
 
I understand the property is being used to house migrants (900 rooms) leaving 400 rooms for leisure travelers.  I have attached a quote to support the remaining for 400 rooms for paying guests. This will allow your guests to continue to access their Netflix, Disney, Hulu etc. apps without disruption.
 
Let me know if this is acceptable.

Hello Joyce,

I called today and left a message for you.  Sorry I missed you!
We handle the WIFI system & support services for your property and I
just wanted to check in and see how things are going with your
services and support.  Is everything working to your satisfaction?

Any feedback would be great or if you can let us know if there is
something I can help with.

Looking forward to hearing back from you.

We've noticed the Guest Wi-Fi is down at the property at

The Taj Boston
15 Arlington Street
Boston , MA   02116
617-536-5700.

As we know we could have a power outage on the property, because I can't access to the Fusion and couldn't ping the ISP fiber circuit either.

Called the ISP CenturyLink and  they didn't report an outage in the area. They gave me a ticket number just in case: 22627307.
They can't access to their devices either on the property.

Please update us, if you know more.

Dear Monica,
 
I normally check in with Hector but this morning I was redirected
to Angel Negron.  Unfortunately I do not have any contact information
for Angel, so I thought I would contact you this time.
 
We handle the WIFI and support services for your property 
and I just wanted to check in and see how things are going with your
services and support.  Is everything working to your satisfaction?
 
I’d appreciate any feedback you have or please let us know if
there’s anything we can help with.  Thank you.

Hi Patrick,

We’re trying to replace the FourWinds server at the Park Central NYC. I found out that it’s currently on WiFi, but on the Highgate network on a dedicated VLAN. I was informed it’s on the “HOTSOS VLAN”. It’s current IP is 10.60.31.23

The new server we purchased doesn’t have a wireless NIC.  We’ll need to hard wire the new server.  I assume this will require reconfiguring 1 port on a switch for this VLAN. Can you let me know the costs for this or if you need any additional info?

Thanks,

Previously when this switch was going offline was it was causing all devices connected to it, and most of the APs on the network go go offline.
When the new Brocade switch was connected a similar problem occurred.  Juan found that the problem was coming from a device connected to port 4 of the switch which showed up on lldp as ""mezz_phones"" which is likely short for mezzanine phones.  This switch is a Procurve J9089A.  Bill Sims reported that this switch did not have link on any of its ports except for the port that was connected to the .11 switch so we decided to unplug it since it was causing network problems.  As soon as this switch is unplugged the problem with all the APs going offline goes away.
There are now extra ports available in the MDF since this new switch is a 48 port switch.  The previous switch was only 24 ports and there was only 1 open port in the MDF.",Information,,2019-06-12 14:11:16.980,, ,,Contact not found.

Yes, it was down, we've noticed that also. I called the hotel and we was working with Angel. He reported, in the MDF in WestHouse the temperature is very hot. We trying to cool this room down. Restarted the Fusion 2x and it came back for 2 minutes and went down again. We will need to troubleshoot it and find out if we need to replace that gateway.

Right now the guest Wi-Fi is up and running, temporarily interconnected with Park Central until we will fix the issue.

We will let you know what we found out.

The system went down with Fatal 500 Error in the Web Server.

**** What to communicate to the hotel ****
We have replaced the faulty hard drive in the system

9 pm. After investigating this we have discovered that the hard drive was full. We contacted RGNets and worked with them on this issue. Darrian cleaned the Development logs from the Fusion which freed up the space. After poking around Darrian concluded that there were missing files from the OS and the hard drive is most likely failing.

Instead of rebooting it one more time, which I think might of solved the problem (but we will never know at this point time), I started re-installing the OS via IPMI. This took all night. It failed several times and in the process I have update the IPMI version on the Fusion. The upload speeds were between 200Kbps and 5 Mbps.

7 am A tech from Field Nation (Bobby Hoang) arrived at the property. Bobby was able to help me load the OS on the Fusion. We have tried multiple times with automatic backup recovery from a flash drive and it failed.

11 am At this point we concluded that we needed a new hard drive and Bobby went to get one from Best Buy. While Bobby was doing that, I have tried to install OS one more time, but this time without having backup attached on a stick to the Fusion. The OS loaded and got to the licensing stage.

12 pm Bobby came back and we have installed the new drive. When he was installing the new drive, he installed it in the place of the old drive, inside a caddy. Caddy is a passive device that plugs in between SATA cables and the drive itself. It's purpose is to support the drive in place. Bobby removed the caddy and the system recognized the new (samsung) drive right away. At that point we have decided to put the original hard drive in place and test. The drive worked just fine

1 pm The system was restored to its working state. Portal page was tested with Bobby using a shared credential. 

1 pm Ceasar the Manager at the hotel called me from Bobbie's phone and thanked me and asked me to give Bobby a promotion for good work done.",Equipment Change,,2019-07-07 13:17:50.760,, ,,Contact not found.

Any feedback would be great or if you can let us know if there is something I can help with. I have copied Casey as well in case she has something to input.

Subject: [EXTERNAL MESSAGE] - Park Central: Just checking in
 
Dear Jeffry,
 
I recently received an email from Monica Campian introducing you as the new 
Director of Engineering and Guiseppe Zoida as your new Assistant Director of
Engineering.  Congratulations on your new positions!  
 
I wanted to take a moment to introduce myself.  I am the Customer Service Manager
here at Hotel Internet Services. We handle the WIFI and support services for Park Central
and I wanted to check in to see how things are going.  Is everything being handled to your 
satisfaction? Is there anything you need from us?
 
I’d appreciate any feedback you have or please let us know if there’s anything we can help with.
Thank you, and have a great holiday weekend!
  
Kind regards,
 
 
 
Debbie Dobbe • Customer Service Manager

I called today and left a message for you. Sorry I missed you! We handle the WIFI system & support services for the hotel and I just wanted to check in and see how things are going with your support services. Is everything working to your satisfaction?

Any feedback would be great or if you can let us know if there is something I can help with.

Just for an interesting read, we recently did a full survey of guests and hoteliers that is chalk full of good bits of information. Here is the link for that - https://www.hotelwifi.com/gre-survey-wp/

Looking forward to hearing back from you.

The APs what you are referring to, they was online recently. It is possible someone took it (stole it), or someone moved to different location in the room, or different room (technician), but those was online for sure. That is possible it moved to any of the closest room also.
So if you don't find an AP, try to go to the next room, or across to the hallway room. It might be there. To verify it when it is down, your only chance to have the MAC address on the back of the label. If it is match, that's id the AP what we looking for. If not, need search.

We usually have two places to place the APs. One is on the back of the desk, and another is in the soffit. It might hides there. See pic.

Please let me know, thank you!

been getting a lot of interest.  After a survey of over 700 guests, we found that
65% of them wanted to cast their own content onto the TV.  Here is a link to the

Perfect. Thank you! That’s good to know.
 
Are there any other yearly licensing invoices other than the Fusion yearly renewals (Invoice 95279 from February) that I will be starting this year, or is this all of them?
 
Appreciate your help with this. Just trying to get an accurate picture of the budget going forward with our Accounting team.
 
Thanks,

Hi Trey,
 
As of this invoice, it's annual. When the equipment was installed in 2022, you initially had 3 years of software.

There is a Cisco switch with two Gig ports. The right hand ports is the ISP Feed which goes on Cat5e cable to the IDF on the 34th Floor. On the 34th floor the ISP Feed plugs into port 19 on blade F. The reason the ISP Feed was down was that the 34th IDF Switch was down due to being plugged into a failed UPS. I moved the 34th IDF Switch off the dead UPS an onto a separate power stripe.

Hey Debbie,
 
I apologize for the delay; I was off over the past few days. 
We are still having issues, but per our engineering department says this is a wiring issue and unrelated to the wireless units. They have someone coming in to assist.
 
Thank you!

Dear Steven,
 
Thanks for your time this afternoon. I appreciate you telling me about the
recurring problem with WIFI coverage in room #903. 
 
I have forwarded this directly to our Support team, who will be happy to dig
in and help get it resolved.  I will check in with you again to ensure all is
handled.  Meanwhile, don’t hesitate to call if there’s anything else you need.
 
Have a good weekend!

Hi Sally,
 
I know we spoke in November but as I mentioned, I like to check
in every few months just to ensure all is still running smoothly
with the WIFI system and support services for your property.
I called today and left a message for you.  Sorry I missed you!
 
How are things going currently? Is everything working to your satisfaction?
 
Any feedback would be great or if you can let us know if there is
something I can help with.
 
Looking forward to hearing back from you.
 
Best,

Make sure that in cases such as this one you provide some sort of prove first.  
I think you probably made the mistake of thinking this switch is supposed to be in Royalton Park Avenue.  
I also checked the equipment list and the switch does belong to the Royalton Hotel.

We've noticed 2 switch is down at the property of

The Taj Boston
15 Arlington Street
Boston , MA   02116
617-536-5700.

The Taj Boston SW-IDF-Newbury-8-1 switch showing down in our Nagios monitoring system, and can't ping it from the Fusion. The IDF might lost power, or if the switch is up, then we will need to power cycle it. Simply unplug the power cord from the back of the SW, wait 10 seconds and plug it back. That should bring back the switch online.

As you notified us, the business center is moved to the basement because of the 3rd floor construction, so I assume the 3rd floor business center SW will be out until the construction is done. If yes, we will disable the notification for that SW for that time period.

Please let us know if any issues.

Thank you,

Best,

If you or someone can go there, and try to access to the Guest Wi-Fi in the rooms we can troubleshoot it there what is happening and have more information what we need to fix the issue if we really have.

2020-06-27 04:57:03 - When there is a power outage in the MDF the cluster controller will not come back up automatically. The power button on the front of the Fusion has to be pressed to turn them on. In addition to this, a keyboard needs to be connected to the cluster controller, and F2 has to be pressed so that it will boot up. Rick Gomez has done this before and knows how to do it.

I was now able to ping the default gateway for the Fusion in that subnet (66.166.238.105) but not the Fusion (66.166.238.106). From the Fusion I could ping out to the gateway and to the internet. Megapath was not able to confirm if there was a firewall setting that was preventing remote access to the Fusion.

I called today and left a message for you. Sorry I missed you! We handle the WIFI system & support services for the hotel and I just wanted to check in and see how things are going with your support services. Is everything working to your satisfaction?

Any feedback would be great or if you can let us know if there is something I can help with.
Just for an interesting read, we recently did a full survey of guests and hoteliers that is chalk full of good bits of information. Here is the link for that - https://www.hotelwifi.com/gre-survey-wp/

Looking forward to hearing back from you.

I hope all is well.

We have noticed that the Fusion Gateway for the Wifi at Park Central San Francisco Hotel has been down for about 4 hours now. We have been trying to contact the hotel phone number at 415.974.6400, but we can't go through at all. It goes straight to a busy tone every time we dial the number. Please check and see that there is power to the equipment. Otherwise, a reboot of the Fusion box should restore it.

Hi Jack,
 
I just got off the phone with Arianna McConneaughey, the Assistant
Director of the Front Office at this property. She reported an issue with
poor connectivity on 7/22 and we sent a tech out who reported missing
APs and other equipment issues. She mentioned that she thought she
had heard from you but couldn’t remember.
 
At any rate, they have complaints in right now from guests in rooms
1835 & 1836 that they have spotty coverage. She has also had
complaints from the 20th floor.  She understands that there are APs
out and equipment issues and she would like you to call her and
then send over a quote for the work needed to fix things so she can
submit it to her superiors.
 
Can you please reach out to her?

Hello all,
 
We are checking this request because approximately, a month ago, we had a Field Technician working on your property. He reported a lot of APs removed for rehab tasks and others were reported as stealing. I would like to have more information regarding the room with connectivity issues to create a request for our sales team. 
 
Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance.

Hi Debbie,
 
I will double-check with the installation team on this because they recently sent a technician there to check the APs on the property. After that, we realized a lot of APs were down because they were removed, the power adapter was broken, and DSLAM issues. 
 
Please let me know if I can help with anything else.

Hi Ariana!
 
Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today – I could see that you
were busy and I appreciate you taking the time to speak with me and let me know of
the connectivity issue a few of your guests have reported when they go to their rooms.
I understand and noted your comment that they are able to connect easily in the lobby
but sometimes lose connectivity once in their rooms.
 
As I mentioned, I have sent this to our Support team, who will be happy to help. I have
asked them to reach out to the Front Desk Manager on call.
 
I will be checking in with you next week to ensure things are improving. Meanwhile, please
don’t hesitate to call anytime if I can be of further assistance – we’re here to help!
 
Have a great evening!

All of the ap's were going up and down and the 28th floor switch was down. I worked with an engineer on this. At first i i had him reboot the switch but that did not do anything. I finally had him unplug all of the Ethernet cables except the uplink (port24 ) then had him plug the cables back one at a time. This was able to bring the network back up. He said there was a cable that was plugged into the switch on both ends.I just had him unplug the cable from the switch ,Information,,2016-12-27 08:23:36.527,, ,,Contact not found.

Any feedback would be great or if you can let us know if there is something I can help with.

Just for an interesting read, we recently did a full survey of guests and hoteliers that is chalk full of good bits of information. Here is the link for that - https://www.hotelwifi.com/gre-survey-wp/

Looking forward to hearing back from you.

The equipment was going to be installed in a retail space that has since been shut down and leased to another party (equipment not needed). Kevin Mello of ""INTECH"" will be storing the equipment in the server room for future use elsewhere. We are closing out the project at his request, but should assist with configuration later since he will have already paid for it.",Information,,2021-01-11 10:40:50.790,, ,,Contact not found.

I called today and left a message for you. Sorry I missed you! We handle the WIFI system & support services for the hotel and I just wanted to check in and see how things are going with your support services. Is everything working to your satisfaction?

Any feedback would be great or if you can let us know if there is something I can help with.

Just for an interesting read, we recently did a full survey of guests and hoteliers that is chalk full of good bits of information. Here is the link for that - https://www.hotelwifi.com/gre-survey-wp/

Looking forward to hearing back from you.

Best,
Shelly Chandler
